# TASKS.md — Work queue for coding sessions

Each task is a **self-contained briefing**. A subagent starts from near-zero context, so a
task must name every input it needs: the `/sumo/` reference file, the target C# files, the
scenario, the command, and the numeric done-condition. Do tasks in order. One task = one
committed, green state you can check out later and continue from.

Read `CLAUDE.md` (rules) and `DESIGN.md` (architecture) before starting any task.

Legend: **[net]** = needs network + human (golden regen / vendoring); everything else is
the offline `dotnet test` loop.

---

## Task 0 — Bootstrap the harness (green on a blank checkout)

**Goal.** A committed test harness that passes `dotnet test` on a fresh clone into an empty
VM, **without SUMO and without any simulation engine existing yet**. This is the
checkout-and-continue baseline everything else grows from.

**Why it can be green with no engine and no SUMO.** The harness proves itself with a
*self-test*: feed the comparator two synthetic trajectories that are identical (assert zero
diff) and two that are deliberately offset (assert the diff is detected and localized).
This exercises the whole comparison path offline.

**Create the solution + projects:**
- `Sim.Core` — ECS components/systems/integration (empty scaffolding for now; no models yet)
- `Sim.Ingest` — `.net.xml` / `.rou.xml` parsers (empty scaffolding for now)
- `Sim.Harness` — FCD parsing + trajectory comparison (implement now)
- `Sim.ParityTests` — xUnit test project (implement the self-test now)

**Implement in `Sim.Harness`:**
- An **FCD parser**: read a SUMO `--fcd-output` XML into an in-memory model. Per timestep,
  per vehicle, capture: `id, lane, pos, speed, x, y, angle` and (when present)
  `acceleration`. Structure it for lookup by `(vehicleId, time)`.
- A **trajectory comparator**: given two trajectory sets + a tolerance config, return, per
  attribute: max-abs error, RMSE over the trajectory, and the **first timestep** where any
  attribute exceeds tolerance (or "no divergence"). Compare only vehicle/time pairs present
  in both; report any presence mismatch (missing/extra vehicles or steps) explicitly.
- A **`tolerance.json` schema** + loader: per-attribute tolerances (`pos`, `speed`, `x`,
  `y`, `angle`, `acceleration`) plus a `parityMode` field (`"exact"` | `"statistical"`)
  and an optional `comparedAttributes` list (phase 1 uses `["lane","pos","speed"]` — see
  DESIGN.md "layered comparison metric").

**Define the engine seam (no implementation):**
- `IEngine` in `Sim.Core`: loads a scenario (net + rou + cfg paths), runs N steps, and
  emits a trajectory set in the **same in-memory shape** the FCD parser produces, so engine
  output and golden output are directly comparable. Leave it unimplemented — later tasks
  fill it in.

**Implement in `Sim.ParityTests` (the self-test):**
- Construct two identical synthetic trajectory sets → assert comparator reports zero diff /
  no divergence.
- Construct two sets differing by a known offset at a known step → assert the comparator
  reports that attribute over tolerance and pinpoints the correct first-divergence step.
- Round-trip test: parse a tiny hand-written FCD XML fixture (commit it under
  `scenarios/_fixtures/`) and assert field values load correctly.

**Also create (committed, but not exercised by the test loop):**
- `scripts/install-sumo.sh`, `scripts/regen-goldens.sh`, `SUMO_VERSION` — already drafted;
  place them and make the shell scripts executable (`chmod +x`).
- `.gitignore` for `bin/`, `obj/`, NuGet caches, and any local SUMO install dir.

**Done-condition.** Fresh clone into an empty VM → `dotnet test` **passes on the self-test
alone**, with no SUMO installed and no engine implemented. Commit.

---

## Task 1 [net] — Vendor SUMO + generate the rung-1 golden

**Human/network step**, done once outside the offline loop.

- Vendor SUMO source at the tag matching `SUMO_VERSION` into `/sumo/` (see CLAUDE.md).
- Author the rung-1 scenario under `scenarios/01-single-free-flow/`:
  - `net.net.xml` — one straight edge, one lane, long enough to reach cruising speed
    (e.g. 1000 m), a single speed limit.
  - `rou.rou.xml` — one `<vType>` (passenger defaults; `sigma="0"`) and one vehicle
    departing at a fixed time/speed.
  - `config.sumocfg` — fixed `step-length`, Euler stepping, teleport off, no randomness.
  - `tolerance.json` — `parityMode="exact"`, `comparedAttributes=["lane","pos","speed"]`,
    tight tolerances (e.g. `pos` 1e-3 m, `speed` 1e-3 m/s).
- Run `scripts/regen-goldens.sh` → produces `golden.fcd.xml`, `golden.state.xml`,
  `provenance.txt`. **Commit them.**

**Done-condition.** `/sumo/` present at the correct tag; rung-1 scenario + goldens
committed with provenance stamped at `SUMO_VERSION`.

---

## Task 2 — Ingest + engine skeleton wired to rung 1

**Reference:** `/sumo/src/microsim/MSLane.cpp`, `/sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicle.cpp` for how
position is represented (lane-relative arc-length `pos`, global x/y derived).

- Implement `.net.xml` parsing in `Sim.Ingest` for the rung-1 subset: edges, one lane with
  its `shape` polyline, length, speed limit. Store the network as immutable arrays (see
  DESIGN.md), not entities.
- Implement `.rou.xml` parsing: `<vType>` attributes and a single vehicle/route.
- Implement `IEngine` enough to: place the vehicle, step with **fixed dt**, and emit a
  trajectory in the comparator's shape. Longitudinal position is lane-relative `pos`;
  derive x/y by walking the lane polyline (needed only if x/y are compared — phase 1
  compares `lane,pos,speed`, so x/y derivation can be minimal/stubbed).
- **Lateral field discipline (future-proofing, costs nothing now):** include a `LatOffset`
  in the transform and always write 0. Do not add lateral kinematics yet.

**Done-condition.** Engine runs rung 1 and emits a trajectory the harness can compare
(expected to be OUT of tolerance until Task 3 — that's fine; this task is plumbing).

---

## Task 3 — Krauss car-following, single vehicle free-flow parity

**Reference (read before porting):**
- `/sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/MSCFModel_Krauss.cpp`
- `/sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/MSCFModel.cpp` (base: `maximumSafeStopSpeed*`,
  `finalizeSpeed`, accel/decel bounds)
- Cross-check the safe-speed formula against the paper cited in the project docs
  ("SUMO's Interpretation of the Krauß Model"). **Do not trust remembered formulas** — the
  correct exact form is `v_safe = -b*tau + sqrt((b*tau)^2 + V^2 + 2*b*g)`; the Taylor form
  in the Gemini docs was transcribed with a misplaced gap term. Port from source, verify
  against golden.

**Implement the plan/execute contract (this is the load-bearing part):**
- **Plan phase:** each vehicle computes its next speed from the **start-of-step** state of
  its neighbors, writing the result to its own `MoveIntent` only. No shared writes. (Even
  single-threaded, honor this — it's what makes threading a later scheduling change, not a
  rewrite. See DESIGN.md.)
- **Execute phase:** apply intents, integrate position with the configured method (Euler in
  phase 1), advance `pos`.
- For rung 1 there is no leader, so `v_safe` is unconstrained by a leader; the vehicle
  accelerates (bounded by `accel`) toward `speedFactor * speedLimit` and holds. This
  isolates the acceleration bound + speed cap + integration before following matters.
- **Multi-constraint reducer (build the shape now):** compute next speed as the min over a
  *collection* of speed constraints, even though the collection has size 1 here. Junctions
  and (later) shadow lanes feed the same reducer. See DESIGN.md "seam 1".

**Verify vType init first:** diff your resolved passenger defaults against
`golden.state.xml` (accel 2.6, decel 4.5, sigma 0.5→but forced 0 here, tau 1.0,
minGap 2.5). Ruling out an init bug up front saves chasing trajectory drift.

**Done-condition.** `dotnet test` shows rung-1 trajectory within `tolerance.json` on
`lane,pos,speed` for all steps. Commit. This is the first real parity milestone — it proves
the plan/execute contract, the integration step, and the reducer shape on the smallest
possible surface.

---

## Next batch (define fully when Task 3 is green)

Kept here as a roadmap, not yet as briefings. Each becomes a self-contained task with
its own `/sumo/` references and scenario when we reach it:

4. **Two-vehicle following** — Krauss safe speed with a real leader; steady-state gap.
   Adds leader lookup from the per-lane sorted list. Ref: `MSLane` leader/follower logic.
5. **Approach to a stopped vehicle / dead end** — the discrete `maximumSafeStopSpeedEuler`
   overshoot-prevention math in isolation. The subtle one; nail it alone.
   - Note from rung 4 review: the leader constraint passes `predMaxDecel = leader vType
     `decel``. That is correct while `apparentDecel == decel` (the phase-1 default). If any
     vType overrides `apparentDecel`, revisit whether SUMO uses `getCurrentApparentDecel()`
     rather than `getMaxDecel()` for the leader term (`MSCFModel::maximumSafeFollowSpeed`).
   - Also: `maximumSafeFollowSpeed`'s emergency-decel correction (`decel!=emergencyDecel`) is
     ported but was unexercised by rung 4 — rung 5's hard stop is the first real test of it.
6. **Insertion spacing** — departure FIFO + gap-gated insertion. DONE.
   - Note from rung 6 review: `TryInsertOnLane`'s per-lane break-on-first-failure assumes a
     blocked earlier departure blocks all later ones — exact when all departures share one
     insertion point (as here). If a future scenario puts vehicles at DIFFERENT departPos on
     the same lane, revisit (SUMO retries each pending vehicle independently).
7. **Platoon shockwave** — still `sigma=0`, deterministic; multi-vehicle propagation.
8. **Two lanes + LC2013** — first structural change via command buffer; first real use of
   the multi-constraint reducer with a lateral intent. Ref: `MSLCM_LC2013`. **PARTIALLY DONE.**
   - 8a (scenario `06-two-lane-cruise`): two-lane `.net.xml` ingest + per-lane emission,
     vehicle stays right. Green, no engine change (parser already reads all `<lane>`).
   - 8b (scenario `07-keep-right-change`): the command buffer + lateral intent (seam 4,
     discrete instant lane-index snap) + a MINIMAL faithful slice of `MSLCM_LC2013`'s
     keep-right block, reproducing the exact accumulator so a single empty-road vehicle
     changes right at t=6. Right-neighbor guard leaves all single-lane rungs untouched.
   - **Deferred LC2013 work** (each its own future rung, needs its own scenario+golden):
     strategic (route/connectivity-forced) changes + general best-lanes (`getBestLanes`),
     cooperative changes, speed-gain overtake (the tactical block + `mySpeedGainProbability`),
     safety/blocker vetoes and the neighbor follower/leader gap checks (need a 2-lane
     scenario WITH traffic), `lanechange.duration>0` continuous lateral, and multi-edge lane
     continuity. Also: the command buffer currently applies each vehicle's lane swap inline
     in `ExecuteMoves` (fine for one changer); revisit batching if a scenario has multiple
     simultaneous changers competing for a gap (DESIGN.md conflict-resolution tie-break).
9. **Priority intersection** — right-of-way matrix + link-leader yielding, feeding the
   reducer. Ref: `MSRightOfWayJunction`, `MSLink`. **PARTIALLY DONE.**
   - 9a (scenario `08-junction-straight`): multi-edge routing + internal-lane traversal
     (route expands to a lane sequence via each `<connection>`'s `via`; pos carries over across
     lane boundaries). A major-road vehicle drives straight through, no yielding. Green.
   - **9b — priority yielding — DONE.** Scenario `scenarios/11-priority-junction/` (not `10-`; A1 took
     `10-`); `Rung9bParityTests` green within 1e-3. The whole hard rung was cracked WITHOUT a SUMO
     debug build by hand-matching the golden with the engine's own `KraussModel`. Mechanism (two
     phases, keyed on the foe's location): while the priority major is APPROACHING on its normal lane
     the minor does a stop-line brake `stopSpeed(approachLen − pos − POSITION_EPS=0.1)` (→ `9.433`/
     `4.933`); once the major is on its internal lane `:J_2_0` the minor runs `adaptToJunctionLeader`
     (→ `2.033`), whose `distToCrossing` uses the conflict-WIDTH shift `conflictSize = foeWidth(3.2) ×
     widthFactor(1)` (perpendicular) → crossing shifted back 1.6 m so `vStop = stopSpeed(distToCrossing
     − minGap) = 2.033`; once the major clears, no constraint (free `+2.6`/step). 9b-i (junction
     `<request>` + conflict geometry) and 9b-ii/iii (the reducer constraint + `adaptToJunctionLeader`
     port) are committed; `dotnet test` = 41 green. Determinism policy: static `<request>` priority
     matrix + frozen start-of-step foe snapshot → order-independent (no arrival-time race). Ported
     from `MSLink::setRequestInformation`/`getLeaderInfo` + `MSVehicle::adaptToJunctionLeader`. **Full
     per-step breakdown in `RUNG9B.md` "Progress log".** Summary characterization below.
     Scenario probed: major `WJ JE` (priority),
     minor `SJ JN` (yields); the minor brakes 13.89→9.433→4.933→2.033 as the major approaches,
     threads through just behind it, then accelerates.

     **Mechanism (reverse-engineered from source).** The minor yields by treating the crossing
     major as a virtual "link leader": `MSVehicle::checkLinkLeader` → `adaptToJunctionLeader`
     (MSVehicle.cpp). For a crossing foe with gap≥0 it computes
     `vsafeLeader = MAX2(followSpeed(gap=leaderInfo.second, leaderSpeed, leaderDecel),
     MIN2(v2, vStop))` where `vStop = stopSpeed(distToCrossing − minGap)`,
     `leaderPastCPTime = (distToCrossing − leaderInfo.second) / max(leaderSpeed, haltingSpeed)`,
     `vFinal = MAX2(speed, 2*(distToCrossing − minGap)/leaderPastCPTime − speed)`,
     `v2 = speed + ACCEL2SPEED((vFinal − speed)/leaderPastCPTime)`; then `v = MIN2(v, vsafeLeader)`.
     Geometry (this net): internal lanes cross at (201.60, 198.40) — `:J_1_0` (minor,
     x=201.60 vertical) meets `:J_2_0` (major, y=198.40 horizontal), 5.60 m into each; so
     `distToCrossing = 201.60 − pos` for both.

     **Why it is NOT a single-pass port (the blockers).** Reproducing 9.433 exactly needs, and
     none of these exist in the engine yet:
     1. **Junction conflict geometry** (`MSLink::myConflicts`: crossing point, `lengthBehind-
        Crossing` for both lanes, `conflictSize`/widths, `myRadius`/`sagitta`). netconvert/NBNode
        precomputes this at build time; it is NOT in the `.net.xml`. Must be reimplemented from
        the internal-lane shapes/widths (the crossing point itself IS derivable from geometry, as
        above, but the conflict widths/sagitta are more work).
     2. **Approaching-vehicle registration** (`MSLink::setApproaching`/`getApproaching` →
        `ApproachingVehicleInformation` with `arrivalTime`/`leaveTime`/`willPass`). Each vehicle
        registers its planned arrival/leave at every link it approaches; the minor reads the
        major's registration to decide. This is a genuinely two-vehicle-coupled, stateful pass —
        a new phase between plan and execute.
     3. **`MSLink::getLeaderInfo`** (~396 lines) — the foe-vehicle gap (`leaderInfo.second`) +
        `distToCrossing` computation, with many special cases (contLane, sameTarget/sameSource,
        inTheWay, pastTheCrossingPoint, indirect turns). This is where the exact gap convention
        lives; hand-derivation did not reproduce 9.433 (got 9.39 via followSpeed(0) or 11.57 via
        the vStop branch), i.e. the gap/priority conventions need the real getLeaderInfo, not a
        guess.
     4. **Priority / `isLeader`** (`MSLink::opened`, response/foe matrix, `myJunctionEntryTime`
        ordering) to decide the major is the leader.

     Recommended decomposition when tackled: (9b-i) parse the junction `<request>` response/foes
     matrix + compute conflict geometry from internal-lane shapes; (9b-ii) add the approaching-
     registration pass (arrivalTime/leaveTime) as new engine infrastructure; (9b-iii) port
     getLeaderInfo's gap for the single-crossing case + adaptToJunctionLeader; iterate against the
     golden (target 9.433/4.933/2.033). Also decide here the junction-determinism policy
     (match-SUMO-order vs deterministic tie-break-by-id; DESIGN.md "parallelization").
10. **Traffic light** — `<tlLogic>` state machine; red light as a stop-line constraint. **DONE**
    (scenario `09-traffic-light`; red → `stopSpeed(seen − DIST_TO_STOPLINE_EXPECT_PRIORITY 1.0)`,
    green → traverse; TL sampled at `time+dt` for the emit-before-plan ordering).
    - Note from rung 10 review: `TrafficLightState.IsRedOrYellow` matches only `'r'`/`'y'`;
      widen to `'u'` (red-yellow) and `'Y'` (yellow-major) before a scenario uses those phases.
      Yellow "stop if you can brake, else go" decision logic is also not yet built (no yellow here).
11. **Parameter-extraction cross-check pass** — automated diff of C# vType defaults vs the
    committed golden across all scenarios, run before trajectory tests as a fast fail. **DONE**
    (`ParameterCrossCheckTests`, a data-driven `[Theory]` over every scenario's
    `golden.vtype.json` `vTypes`; subsumes the former per-scenario init cross-checks). Note: it
    diffs against `golden.vtype.json` (the empirical libsumo/TraCI dump), NOT `golden.state.xml`,
    because `--save-state` does not expand implicit vType defaults (see the IMMEDIATE-task finding
    / DESIGN.md). Rung 1's pure-defaults reference stays covered by `VTypeInitCrossCheckTests`.

At rung 8+ decide explicitly the junction determinism policy (match-SUMO-order vs
deterministic-tie-break-by-id); see DESIGN.md "parallelization". Sublane/laneless mode is a
whole separate phase layered on top — no task here should preclude it (see the four seams).

---

## Extended roadmap — deferred features (characterized, not yet briefed)

Two distinct groups. **Group A** continues the SUMO-parity ladder: same golden-FCD validation, same
"port from `/sumo/`, match to 1e-3" bar, each its own scenario + golden. **Group B** is a direction
shift — reacting to *live external inputs that are not in an offline SUMO run* — so golden-FCD parity
does NOT directly apply; it needs a different validation model (see the Group B framing note). Both
groups are additive to the architecture (the multi-constraint reducer + the four seams + the command
buffer absorb them); neither is a rewrite. Order within each group respects the dependencies noted.

### Group A — completes the lane-based SUMO-parity core

- **A1. Multi-vClass vType resolver** (prerequisite; low-risk, high-value). **DONE.**
  `VTypeDefaults.Resolve` (was `ResolvePassenger`) now dispatches on `vType.VClass` over a curated
  road-vClass table: passenger, truck, bus, coach, delivery, trailer, bicycle, motorcycle, moped,
  emergency. Ported straight from the vendored source: `SUMOVTypeParameter.cpp`
  `VClassDefaultValues` ctor (minGap/maxSpeed/width/height), `getDefaultAccel`/`getDefaultDecel`/
  `getDefaultEmergencyDecel` (the `MAX2(decel, vcDecel)` form, kept derived — not hardcoded)/
  `getDefaultImperfection`, and `SUMOVehicleClass.cpp::getDefaultVehicleLength`. Passenger path is
  byte-identical (inert-when-absent); out-of-scope classes (rail*, tram, ship, pedestrian, …) still
  throw `NotSupportedException`; null/empty vClass resolves to passenger per SUMO's parser default.
  Validated by scenario `10-truck-free-flow` (truck accel 1.3 + maxSpeed 36.11 both bind; speed
  limit 40): `ParameterCrossCheckTests` picks up its `golden.vtype.json` and `RungA1ParityTests`
  checks the truck free-flow trajectory. `dotnet test` = 30 green. Adding another vClass now = one
  scenario + golden; the tests extend for free. `getVehicleStopOffset` was not needed (not a
  resolved-vType field). Remaining classes for A3/etc. (each its own scenario+golden when reached).
- **A2. Overtaking (speed-gain lane change). DONE.** `scenarios/12-overtake/` + golden: a fast
  follower overtakes a slow leader (`maxSpeed=5`) on a 2-lane edge — LEFT change at t11→t12,
  keep-right RETURN at t19→t20; `RungA2ParityTests` green within 1e-3. The "open subtlety" was NOT a
  look-ahead gap — it was step ORDERING: SUMO runs `planMovements → executeMovements → changeLanes`
  (`MSNet.cpp:784/790/796`), so the lane-change decision uses the POST-move leader gap. Feeding the
  post-move gap into `relativeGain = (neighLaneVSafe − thisLaneVSafe)/max(neighLaneVSafe,10)` (with
  `thisLaneVSafe = min(vMax, maximumSafeFollowSpeed(gap,…,onInsertion:true))`) reproduces the golden
  exactly (accumulate `+= relGain`, fire at `>0.2`, reset on change). Implemented as a NEW post-move
  phase `Engine.DecideSpeedGainChanges`; keep-right was MOVED into the same phase (both LC decisions
  run post-move, matching SUMO's single `changeLanes` pass) — 8a/8b stay byte-identical. Extended
  `LaneNeighborQuery` with adjacent-lane leader+follower; added a faithful `IsTargetLaneSafe`
  secure-gap veto (non-binding on the empty target lane here — the full blocker veto wants a scenario
  WITH target-lane traffic). `dotnet test` = 44 green. **Future note (non-blocking):** enforce a
  single LC decision per vehicle per step before a scenario stresses both keep-right and speed-gain
  on one vehicle in one step. **See `RUNGA2.md` for the full breakdown.** Original characterization
  below.
- **A2 (original). Overtaking (speed-gain lane change).** The other main branch of LC2013's `_wantsChange`
  (the one rung 8b did NOT port — rung 8b was keep-right only). A vehicle held up by a slower leader
  accumulates `mySpeedGainProbability` from the potential speed advantage and changes left when it
  crosses `myChangeProbThresholdLeft`; keep-right (rung 8b) brings it back after passing. Ref:
  `MSLCM_LC2013.cpp` `_wantsChange` speed-gain block + `mySpeedGainProbability` accumulation.
  **Requires the target-lane safety veto** — the neighbor leader/follower gap check
  (`MSLCM_LC2013::checkChangeBeforeCommitting` / the `blocked` logic) that rung 8b never exercised
  (it changed lanes on an empty road). So this is the first LC rung with *traffic on the target lane*
  and needs the `LaneNeighborQuery` extended to return the adjacent lane's leader AND follower.
  Scenario: a 2-lane road, a slow leader (maxSpeed capped, as rung 4's leader) with a fast follower
  that overtakes then returns. Note: on a SINGLE lane, "no overtaking" is already CORRECT (rung 4's
  follower correctly settles behind the slow leader forever) — this rung is strictly a multi-lane
  addition. De-risk the decision via TraCI `getParameter(..., "laneChangeModel.speedGainProbability"/
  "speedGainLP")` exactly as rung 8b used `keepRightP`.
- **A3. Priority / emergency vehicles. PARTIALLY DONE (ignore-red slice).** Two behaviors were in
  scope: (i) the emergency vehicle's own privileges (ignoring red/foes); (ii) OTHER vehicles giving
  way. **DONE: (i) ignore-RED** — `scenarios/16-emergency-red` + golden: an emergency vehicle with the
  junction-model ATTRIBUTE `jmDriveAfterRedTime="1000"` drives straight through junction J's RED
  light at free-flow, ported from `MSVehicle::ignoreRed` (the `jmDriveAfterRedTime > redDuration`
  arm). `VType`/`ResolvedVType` gained `JmDriveAfterRedTime` (default -1 = never ignore, so INERT for
  every other vType — rung 10 byte-identical); `TrafficLightState.GetPhaseElapsed` gives `redDuration`;
  `RedLightConstraint` returns +inf when the vehicle ignores red. Also the first real-SUMO validation
  of A1's emergency vClass table (ParameterCrossCheck on scenario 16). `RungA3ParityTests` green;
  `dotnet test` = 61. Gated ACCEPT. **DEFERRED (each its own future rung + scenario):** the `!canBrake`
  ignore-red arm; **ignore-FOE** at junctions — note `jmIgnoreJunctionFoeProb` only bypasses the
  on-junction link-leader path (`checkLinkLeader`), NOT 9b's `opened()`/approaching stop-line yield,
  so a real "emergency ignores a priority foe" needs the `opened()`-level ignore too; and behavior
  **(ii) give-way** (other vehicles moving aside — the LC blue-light layer). "priority *road*"
  right-of-way is rung 9b, not this.

### Group B — beyond parity: live external-obstacle reactivity

**Framing (read before briefing any B task).** These react to obstacles injected from OUTSIDE the
simulation — a non-SUMO vehicle, a pedestrian, a robot, a real-world detection — that are NOT present
in the fixed offline SUMO run the goldens come from. Consequences:
- The golden-FCD parity harness does **not** directly validate them (there is no SUMO golden for "an
  external object appeared at t=12"). Validate with **behavioral / property tests** (e.g. "the
  vehicle's front never overlaps the obstacle", "it resumes within N s of the obstacle clearing",
  "it never routes onto a closed edge") plus, WHERE a SUMO analog exists (dynamic rerouting via
  `MSDevice_Routing`/`<rerouter>`, or a stopped blocker), a targeted parity scenario.
- This makes the engine a **live simulator with external inputs**, not only an offline parity
  reproducer. `IEngine` needs an input surface to inject/update/remove external obstacles between
  steps (a small API: `AddObstacle(laneId, pos, length, ...)`, cleared/updated per step). Keep it
  behind the same plan/execute discipline: obstacles are read start-of-step, like any neighbor.
- It also partly leaves strict SUMO parity as the bar — record that explicitly per task, and keep
  these features **gated/optional** so they never perturb the parity scenarios (same inert-when-
  absent guard pattern as rungs 8b/10).

- **B1. External-obstacle ingestion + "stop before blocker". DONE.** `IEngine` gained
  `AddObstacle`/`RemoveObstacle`/`ClearObstacles` (an `ExternalObstacle` = lane, frontPos, length,
  optional [startTime,endTime) window); an active obstacle feeds the multi-constraint reducer as a
  virtual STOPPED leader (speed 0) via `KraussModel.FollowSpeed`, `+inf` (inert) when none — so every
  parity scenario stays byte-identical. Validation is behavioral (Group-B bar), NOT golden-FCD:
  `RungB1ExternalObstacleTests` asserts no-overlap (follower front ≤ obstacle back every step), the
  Krauss steady gap, and resume-on-removal (stop → accelerate → 13.89). The steady gap is
  cross-checked against the committed SUMO analog `scenarios/13-stopped-leader` (real stopped leader →
  follower front 242.499). Fixture: `scenarios/14-external-obstacle` (single follower, NO golden).
  `dotnet test` = 48 green. Gated ACCEPT.
- **B2. Network routing layer. DONE.** `Sim.Ingest.NetworkRouter(NetworkModel)` + `Route(fromEdge,
  toEdge)` — Dijkstra over the edge-connectivity graph (arc A→B iff a `<connection from=A to=B>`
  between two normal edges exists = SUMO's turn-permission graph; internal `:`-edges excluded), edge
  cost = `length / max-lane-speed` (free-flow travel time, SUMO's `DijkstraRouter`/`MSDevice_Routing`
  default effort), deterministic (dist, then edge-id) tie-break, `[from]` for from==to, `null` for
  unknown/internal/unreachable. Purely additive (no engine/parity code touched). Validated by
  `RungB2RouterTests` against a committed SUMO `duarouter` golden
  (`scenarios/_fixtures/routing-diamond/`: top path AB/BD beats bottom AC/CD; golden routes
  `SA→DE`/`SA→CD`/`AB→DE` reproduced exactly) + trivial/unreachable/turn-permission cases. `dotnet
  test` = 55 green. Gated ACCEPT. Ready for B3 to consume (`Sim.Core` references `Sim.Ingest`).
- **B3. Reroute-around on prolonged blockage. DONE.** When an active B1 obstacle sits on a FUTURE
  edge of a vehicle's route and persists past `Engine.RerouteThresholdSeconds`, the engine recomputes
  a route via the B2 `NetworkRouter.Route(currentEdge, destEdge, avoid={blockedEdge})` and replaces
  the vehicle's `LaneSequence` (seam-4 structural mutation, run once per step before plan; keeps Pos
  since `newEdges[0]==currentEdge`; `AvoidedEdges` prevents re-triggering). INERT by default
  (`RerouteThresholdSeconds` = +inf → `UpdateReroutes` returns immediately), so no parity scenario is
  perturbed. `NetworkRouter` gained a `Route(from,to,avoidEdges)` overload. Validation is behavioral
  (Group-B): `RungB3RerouteTests` on `scenarios/15-reroute` (diamond net, vehicle routed top path
  SA AB BD DE) — (1) persistent obstacle on BD + threshold 5 → diverts to the bottom path
  SA AC CD DE, never enters BD, reaches DE; (2) obstacle clears before the threshold → keeps the top
  path; (3) disabled by default → inert even with an obstacle present. `dotnet test` = 59 green.
  Gated ACCEPT. (Optional future: a matched SUMO `<rerouter>` parity scenario.)
- **B4. U-turn when no route around exists. SKIPPED — superseded by navmesh/RVO movement.** A
  free-form reversal maneuver is a poor fit for SUMO's lane-based car-following (opposite-edge/bidi
  topology + a reversal that has no clean golden). Decision (session): defer this to a
  continuous/agent-based movement layer (navmesh path + RVO collision avoidance), where a U-turn is
  natural and the validation bar is behavioral/plausibility, not golden-FCD parity. See the
  navmesh/RVO note under Group C (C10 sublane/continuous is the bridge) and the external-agent interop
  (B5). Not planned as a lane-based rung.

**Suggested order (Groups A/B, done this session):** A1 → 9b (RUNG9B.md) → A2 → B1 → B2 → B3 → A3.
All committed green. Below is the realism roadmap that extends the engine toward believable ground
traffic; it is characterized (not yet briefed), same as the original "next batch" was.

---

## Realism roadmap (Group C + external-agent interop) — characterized, not yet briefed

Grounded in a session-end gap analysis. Two organizing facts drive the order:

1. **The determinism ladder.** Phase 1 is `sigma=0`/Euler/`actionStepLength=1` for EXACT parity.
   Almost everything realistic (stop-and-go waves, capacity, heterogeneous speeds, gap acceptance)
   needs `sigma>0` and per-entity RNG → a **statistical parity** bar (aggregate/ensemble, not 1e-3).
   `tolerance.json` already carries a `parityMode` field for exactly this. C1 is the gate.
2. **Lane-plan vs edge-plan.** Routing (B2) and LC so far are EDGE-level. Correct multi-lane traffic
   needs a LANE plan (which lane reaches the next connection). C2 is the gate for that.

Keep every new feature **inert-when-absent** so the deterministic parity scenarios (rungs 1–11, A1–
A3) remain the byte-for-byte correctness anchor (same discipline as rungs 8b/10/B1–B3/A3).

### The external-agent interop (the "SUMO respects non-SUMO agents" direction — HIGH PRIORITY)

- **B5. DONE (all three sub-rungs B5-i/B5-ii/B5-iii). Moving external agents as dynamic obstacles /
  foes (generalizes B1).** B1 already lets SUMO
  lane-based vehicles STOP behind a STATIC external obstacle (a virtual stopped leader on one lane).
  Generalize to **moving** external agents driven OUTSIDE SUMO (navmesh + RVO, a pedestrian crowd, a
  real detection): SUMO vehicles must *respect* them as (a) a dynamic **leader/follower on a lane**
  (obstacle carries a velocity → `FollowSpeed` with `predSpeed≠0`, and a `predMaxDecel`), (b) a
  **cross-lane blocker** vetoing lane changes (feed into A2's `IsTargetLaneSafe`/neighbor query), and
  (c) a **junction foe** the reducer yields to (feed the external agent's position/arrival into 9b's
  `JunctionYieldConstraint` as an approaching foe). The external agent's motion is NOT SUMO's model,
  so there is NO golden — validate **behaviorally** (no overlap; SUMO vehicle yields/brakes/avoids
  correctly; resumes when clear). This is the core two-way-sharing interop the project is aiming at:
  the navmesh/RVO agents move freely; the lane-based traffic reacts. Reuse the B1 `_obstacles` surface
  (extend `ExternalObstacle` with velocity/heading + a per-step update). Depends on B1 + 9b + A2.
  Inert-when-absent.

  **Decomposed (like 9b) — one shared `ExternalObstacle` velocity extension, three integration points:**
  - **B5-i. DONE. Dynamic leader/follower on a lane.** `ExternalObstacle` (Sim.Core/ExternalObstacle.cs)
    extended with `Speed` and `MaxDecel` (both default 0.0, so every existing `AddObstacle` call site
    is unaffected). `IEngine`/`Engine` gained `AddMovingObstacle(id, laneId, frontPos, length, speed,
    maxDecel, startTime=-inf, endTime=+inf)` (add-or-replace by id, same keying as `AddObstacle`) and
    `UpdateObstacle(id, frontPos, speed)` (no-op if `id` absent; preserves LaneId/Length/StartTime/
    EndTime/MaxDecel via `record with`). `Engine.AdvanceObstacles(dt)` dead-reckons `FrontPos +=
    Speed*dt` for every `Speed != 0` obstacle, called ONCE per step in the `[SystemPhase.Input]`
    section of `Run(int)` — BEFORE `neighbors.Refill`/`PlanMovements` — so the Plan phase always reads
    an already-advanced-for-this-step but otherwise FROZEN obstacle position (never mutated mid-plan);
    `Speed==0` obstacles are skipped entirely, so AdvanceObstacles is a no-op for every B1/static
    obstacle. `ObstacleConstraint` now passes `predSpeed: nearest.Speed`, `predMaxDecel: nearest.Speed
    != 0 ? nearest.MaxDecel : v.VType.Decel` — the conditional is what keeps a `Speed==0` obstacle
    byte-identical to B1: at `predSpeed=0`, `KraussModel.BrakeGap(0, ...)` is 0 regardless of the decel
    argument, so the formula provably never uses `predMaxDecel` in that case, and it still receives the
    same `v.VType.Decel` B1 always passed. For a moving obstacle this exactly mirrors
    `LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`'s real-leader call. New behavioral tests in
    `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungB5MovingObstacleTests.cs` (mirrors `RungB1ExternalObstacleTests`'s
    structure/idiom, reusing `scenarios/14-external-obstacle`): (1) no-overlap-ever against a
    per-step-reconstructed moving obstacle back position, plus late-state trailing at a positive speed
    near the obstacle's own speed with a bounded gap; (2) resume-to-free-flow-max within a bounded step
    count after the obstacle deactivates (`endTime`); (3) a `Speed=0` `AddMovingObstacle` reproduces
    B1's exact stop-at-`242.499` steady state, proving the moving path degenerates exactly to B1.
    `RungB1ExternalObstacleTests` and scenarios 13/14 verified unchanged/still green. Full suite: 67
    green (64 baseline + 3 new Facts), 0 failed.
  - **B5-ii. DONE. Cross-lane blocker vetoing lane changes.** `DecideSpeedGainChanges` (Engine.cs) now
    takes `(double time, double dt)` (was `dt` only) — `Run(int)`'s call site threads its loop `time`
    through, needed only so the veto below can evaluate an obstacle's `[StartTime, EndTime)` active
    window at the same instant every other obstacle read this step uses; nothing else in the pre-
    existing keep-right/speed-gain math reads `time`. New `TargetLaneBlockedByObstacle(ego, targetLane,
    time, dt)`: returns `false` immediately when `_obstacles` is empty (the same empty-store fast path
    `ObstacleConstraint` documents — the inert-when-absent guard). Otherwise, for each obstacle active
    at `time` whose `LaneId == targetLane.Id`, treats it as a virtual neighbor against ego's PROJECTED
    target-lane slot `[ego.Pos - ego.VType.Length, ego.Pos]` (the instant lane-index snap the commit
    gate performs uses ego's own POST-move Pos unchanged, only LaneId moves): obstacle entirely ahead
    (`obstacleBack >= egoFront`) is a virtual `neighLead` requiring `IsTargetLaneSafe`'s own leader
    secure-gap (`SecureGap(ego.Speed, ego.VType, obstacle.Speed, obstacle.MaxDecel, dt)`, mirroring
    `LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`/`ObstacleConstraint`'s existing predSpeed/predMaxDecel plumbing
    exactly); obstacle entirely behind (`obstacleFront <= egoBack`) is a virtual `neighFollow` requiring
    the same secure-gap with the obstacle playing follower — since `ExternalObstacle` has no vType,
    two documented (conservative, gap-widening) proxies stand in: follower decel is
    `obstacle.Speed != 0 ? obstacle.MaxDecel : ego.VType.Decel` (exactly `ObstacleConstraint`'s own
    conditional) and follower minGap/Tau reuse ego's own `VType.MinGap`/`VType.Tau` (no B5-i precedent
    exists for an obstacle-as-follower role at all, so this is a fresh, explicitly-documented choice);
    any other overlap of ego's projected slot is a hard veto (no secure-gap arithmetic needed — there
    is no room to change into at all). `SecureGap` was split into a raw-decel/tau overload (the
    ResolvedVType-taking overload now just forwards to it) so the obstacle-as-follower branch has
    somewhere to pass its proxied decel/tau without a fake `ResolvedVType`; both overloads are
    byte-identical for every existing real-vType call site. Wired into the A2-iii commit gate as a
    SECOND, ANDed veto: `if (IsTargetLaneSafe(...) && !TargetLaneBlockedByObstacle(v, leftLane, time,
    dt))` — a vetoed change does NOT reset `SpeedGainProbability` (same no-reset-on-veto semantics
    `IsTargetLaneSafe`'s own veto already had: MSLCM_LC2013.cpp:1063/1080 only resets on an actually-
    COMMITTED change), so the vehicle keeps its lane, keeps accumulating, and retries every subsequent
    step until the obstacle clears. Inert-when-absent / A2-byte-identical: with `_obstacles` empty the
    helper's own fast path makes the `&&` a no-op, so `RungA2ParityTests`/scenario 12 are untouched and
    remain byte-for-byte identical (verified: unchanged files, still green). New behavioral tests in
    `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungB5LaneChangeVetoTests.cs` (mirrors `RungB5MovingObstacleTests`'s idiom,
    reuses `scenarios/12-overtake`, anchored on the golden-verified `follow` overtake step t=11->12):
    (1) baseline sanity — no obstacle, `follow` still changes to `e0_1` at t=11->12; (2) a whole-lane
    (`FrontPos`==`Length`==lane length, so back=0) static obstacle on `e0_1` active through t=20 holds
    `follow` on `e0_0` for the ENTIRE window (t=11..19), never lets it reach `e0_1` while active, then
    `follow` completes the change within a few steps once the obstacle deactivates (proving the
    accumulator survived every vetoed retry — a delay, not a permanent block); (3) an obstacle on the
    NON-target lane (`e0_0`, positioned with a strictly-negative back so it is also inert to the
    separate `ObstacleConstraint` leader-follow check) does not affect the change at all — same t=11->12
    timing as baseline, proving the veto is target-lane-scoped. Full suite: 70 green (67 baseline + 3
    new Facts), 0 failed.
  - **B5-iii. DONE. Junction foe the reducer yields to.** `JunctionYieldConstraint` (Engine.cs) now
    takes `(double time)` (threaded from `ComputeMoveIntent`'s own `time` parameter, itself threaded
    from `PlanMovements`'s loop variable) — needed only so the new external-agent foe check below can
    evaluate an `ExternalObstacle`'s `[StartTime, EndTime)` active window at the same instant every
    other obstacle read this step uses (`ObstacleConstraint`/`TargetLaneBlockedByObstacle`'s own
    convention); nothing about the pre-existing 9b-ii/iii SUMO-foe machinery reads `time`. New
    `ExternalAgentOnFoeLane(foeInternalLaneId, time)`: returns `false` immediately when `_obstacles` is
    empty (the same empty-store fast path `ObstacleConstraint`/`TargetLaneBlockedByObstacle` already
    document — the inert-when-absent guard), otherwise `true` iff any obstacle is active at `time` AND
    sitting on `foeInternalLaneId` (an external agent "clears" a junction purely by its owner
    deactivating it via `EndTime` or calling `RemoveObstacle` — `AdvanceObstacles`'s dead-reckoned
    `FrontPos` never by itself changes `LaneId`, so lane membership alone is the complete, correct
    signal, exactly as B5-i/B5-ii already treat it; a future refinement letting an agent's own reported
    position signal "physically past the crossing point" is out of scope). Called from INSIDE
    `JunctionYieldConstraint`'s existing foe-link loop, right after `foeInternalLaneId` is resolved and
    INDEPENDENT of `FindFoeVehicle` (so it fires even with zero SUMO vehicles on the junction — the
    pure-external-agent case a `FindFoeVehicle`-only foe scan could never see, since an external agent
    is never wrapped as a `VehicleRuntime`): when true, `constraint = Math.Min(constraint, extConstraint)`
    where `extConstraint` reuses the EXACT approaching-foe stop-line yield the SUMO-foe branch already
    uses (`egoOnInternal ? +infinity : KraussModel.StopSpeed(approachLane.Length - v.Pos - PositionEps,
    ...)`) — ego brakes to a stop before ENTERING its own internal lane while the agent occupies a
    RESPONDED-TO foe lane (`JunctionRequest.RespondsTo`, the static `<request>` bitstring matrix — the
    SAME scoping 9b's SUMO-foe path already enforces, so an agent on a foe link ego's own request row
    does NOT respond to is correctly ignored), and is no longer gated once ego itself has been granted
    entry (`egoOnInternal`), identical to the SUMO-foe approaching branch's own short-circuit.
    Inert-when-absent / 9b-byte-identical: with no obstacle on any foe internal lane,
    `ExternalAgentOnFoeLane`'s empty-store fast path means the new `if` block is never entered, so the
    `Math.Min` beside it never executes and `constraint` is only ever touched by the pre-existing,
    untouched SUMO-foe path — `JunctionYieldConstraint` is byte-for-byte what it was before this rung
    for every obstacle-free scenario. Verified: `scenarios/11-priority-junction`, `08-junction-straight`,
    and `Rung9bParityTests`/`Rung9aParityTests`/`Rung9biJunctionGeometryTests` all unchanged/still green.
    New fixture `scenarios/_fixtures/junction-external-foe/` (behavioral, no golden — net.net.xml copied
    verbatim from scenario 11; rou.rou.xml has ONLY `vMinor` on the minor yielding route SJ→JN, no
    vMajor, so with no external agent the ONLY thing that could make it yield is an injected obstacle).
    New behavioral/differential tests in `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungB5JunctionFoeTests.cs` (mirrors
    `RungB5LaneChangeVetoTests`' idiom): (1) baseline — with no agent (and no vMajor), `vMinor` never
    sustained-stops on its approach lane `SJ_0` and crosses to `JN_0` by t=17 (observed free-flow
    profile: departs at rest, reaches cruise speed 13.89 by t=6, clears the 11.20m internal lane
    `:J_1_0` inside a single 1s step around t=16→17); (2) an external agent on the RESPONDED-TO major
    foe lane `:J_2_0` (link 2, set in link 1's own `response="1100"` row) active `[-inf, 20)` forces
    `vMinor` to brake (the same 9.433/4.933 stop-line profile 9b's own SUMO-foe branch produces) and
    hold at ~pos 192.699 on `SJ_0` through t=19 (differential vs. the baseline, which is already deep
    into `JN_0` at that same t=19), never enters `:J_1_0` while the agent is active, then resumes and
    reaches `JN_0` by t=23 once the agent deactivates at t=20 — proving yield-then-go; (3) an agent on
    the NON-responded-to internal lane `:J_0_0` (link 0, not in link 1's response bits), active for the
    entire run, does NOT force any yield at all — trajectory identical to the no-agent baseline (crosses
    at t=17) — proving the `<request>`-matrix scoping is load-bearing, not "any obstacle near the
    junction stops everyone." Full suite: 73 green (70 baseline + 3 new Facts), 0 failed. **B5 (all
    three sub-rungs — dynamic lane leader/follower, lane-change veto, junction foe) is now DONE.**

### Group C — realism beyond the deterministic phase-1 core

- **C1. Statistical parity / driver imperfection (`sigma>0`). THE determinism-ladder shift; do
  first — unblocks most of the rest.** Port Krauss dawdling (`MSCFModel_Krauss::dawdle`) and the
  per-vehicle SEEDED RNG (CLAUDE.md rule: no `System.Random`; seed per entity so results are
  independent of thread order). Add a **statistical** `parityMode` to the harness.

  **DECISION (owner, this session): the statistical bar is ENSEMBLE/AGGREGATE, not RNG-exact.** We do
  NOT reproduce SUMO's `RandHelper`/MT19937 per-vehicle stream (brittle, version-dependent, and it
  fights the ECS parallelism). Instead we validate aggregate properties over N seeds (mean + spread of
  speed/flow, or the fundamental diagram) within a statistical tolerance. Dawdle is ported to the
  ALGORITHM faithfully; only the RNG *stream* is ours (any good deterministic per-entity-seeded PRNG).

  **Decomposed (like B5/9b):**
  - **C1-i. DONE (OFFLINE, no SUMO). Dawdle + per-entity seeded RNG.** Ported
    `MSCFModel_Krauss::dawdle2` (sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/MSCFModel_Krauss.cpp:129-151) and
    `MSCFModel_KraussOrig1::patchSpeedBeforeLC`'s `MAX2(vMin, dawdle2(vMax, sigma, rng))` bound
    (MSCFModel_Krauss.cpp:90-96, the default per-step `sigmaStep==DELTA_T` path only —
    MSCFModel_Krauss.cpp:73-89's `myDawdleStep > DELTA_T` sub-stepped `accelDawdle` machinery is
    DEFERRED/out of scope) as `KraussModel.Dawdle2`, called from `KraussModel.FinalizeSpeed`
    (`src/Sim.Core/KraussModel.cs`) right where `vNext` used to be set unconditionally to `vMax`:
    `vNext = vType.Sigma > 0.0 ? MAX2(vMin, Dawdle2(vMax, sigma, accel, dt, ref rng)) : vMax`.
    New `VehicleRng` struct (`src/Sim.Core/VehicleRng.cs`) — SplitMix64 (Vigna, public domain), a
    single unmanaged `ulong` of state, `NextDouble()` in `[0,1)`, `SeedFor(globalSeed,
    entityIndex)` mixing the two through one SplitMix64 step. Explicitly NOT SUMO's
    RandHelper/MT19937 stream (owner decision above) — determinism + per-entity independence is
    the bar, not stream-matching. `VehicleRuntime.RngState` (new `VehicleRng` field, unmanaged,
    D3-clean) is seeded ONCE at vehicle creation in `Engine.LoadScenario` from
    `VehicleRng.SeedFor(Seed, entityIndex)`; new `Engine.Seed` property (`ulong`, default 42,
    settable before `LoadScenario` — later ensemble harnesses vary it per run) drives the global
    seed. `ScenarioConfig.Seed`/`ScenarioConfigParser` now also parse the sumocfg's
    `<random_number><seed value="..."/></random_number>` (default 42) for future use, but it is
    NOT auto-applied to `Engine.Seed` (keeps `Engine.Seed` the single caller-controlled source of
    truth, so a caller setting it before `LoadScenario` for an ensemble sweep is never silently
    clobbered). `Engine.ComputeMoveIntent` threads `ref v.RngState` into `FinalizeSpeed` so the
    draw advances that vehicle's own private state in place — no shared/global RNG, so
    `UseParallelPlan=true` stays race-free (each `Parallel.For` iteration only ever touches its
    own entity's `RngState`, exactly the D8 argument already made for every other field). `sigma
    == 0` never calls `Dawdle2` (no draw at all, not a draw-then-multiply-by-zero) → **byte-
    identical to every existing deterministic rung**: confirmed via the full `dotnet test` run
    (78 passed, 0 failed, up from 73) AND by name-checking `Rung1ParityTests`/`Rung9bParityTests`
    (real `golden.fcd.xml`/`tolerance.json` comparisons) still pass unchanged. New fixture
    `scenarios/_fixtures/dawdle-single-lane` (reuses `scenarios/01-single-free-flow`'s net, one
    `sigma=0.5` vehicle "dawdler") + `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC1DawdleTests.cs` (5 new
    behavioral/property tests, no golden): same-seed determinism (byte-identical trajectories),
    sigma>0 reduces mean steady-state speed below free-flow max with positive step-to-step
    variance (contrasted against the sigma=0 control, zero variance), different seeds diverge but
    stay bounded (`speed∈[0,vMax]`, no NaN, non-decreasing position), and `UseParallelPlan=true`
    reproduces the sequential sigma>0 result exactly.
  - **C1-ii. DONE (OFFLINE, no SUMO). Statistical parity harness mode.** Added
    `TrajectoryComparator.CompareEnsemble(actualRuns, expectedRuns, tolerance)`
    (`src/Sim.Harness/TrajectoryComparator.cs`), a sibling to the existing exact-mode `Compare`
    (untouched). For each attribute in `tolerance.ComparedAttributes` (default list, minus `"lane"`
    — categorical, never averaged; silently skipped, documented in the method's XML doc) it pools
    EVERY `(run, vehicle, time)` sample of that attribute across the whole ensemble into one flat
    list (no per-run pre-averaging, no cross-ensemble run alignment) and computes the POPULATION
    mean and std (`sqrt(mean((x-mean)^2))`, not Bessel-corrected) for actual vs. expected. Verdict
    per attribute is `|meanActual-meanExpected| <= meanTolerance` AND `|stdActual-stdExpected| <=
    stdTolerance`; empty ensembles yield mean=std=0 by convention (guarded, no throw/NaN).
    `EnsembleComparisonResult`/`AttributeEnsembleComparisonResult`
    (`src/Sim.Harness/EnsembleComparisonResult.cs`) mirror `ComparisonResult`/
    `AttributeComparisonResult`'s reporting shape (actual/expected/error/withinTolerance for both
    mean and std) so a failing test prints which stat failed and by how much. Explicitly deferred:
    a per-time-bin flow/density (fundamental-diagram) variant — this only does whole-ensemble
    pooling, documented as the richer later extension.
    Schema: extended `ToleranceConfig` (`src/Sim.Harness/ToleranceConfig.cs`) with an optional
    `IReadOnlyDictionary<string, StatisticalAttributeTolerance>? Statistical` property (new record
    `StatisticalAttributeTolerance(double Mean, double Std)`) and `MeanToleranceFor`/
    `StdToleranceFor` accessors mirroring `ToleranceFor`. JSON shape (new optional top-level
    `"statistical"` object, keyed by attribute name):
    `{"parityMode":"statistical","statistical":{"speed":{"mean":0.5,"std":0.5},"pos":{"mean":5.0,"std":5.0}}}`.
    `parityMode="exact"` configs are untouched — the new DTO field is nullable/absent, and
    `ToleranceConfigDto`/`Load`/`Parse` parse existing exact JSON byte-for-byte as before (verified
    by a self-test that round-trips an existing-shape exact JSON and asserts `Statistical` is null
    and every prior accessor is unchanged).
    Self-test `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC1StatisticalHarnessTests.cs` (8 new tests, no SUMO, no
    scenario files, no golden — synthetic in-memory `TrajectorySet` ensembles built with a
    deterministic splitmix64-style local generator, mirroring the Task-0 comparator self-test
    idiom): identical ensembles match (mean/std error ~0); a mean-shifted actual ensemble fails and
    is attributed specifically to `MeanWithinTolerance=false` with `StdWithinTolerance=true`; an
    actual ensemble with inflated noise amplitude (same mean, much larger spread) fails and is
    attributed specifically to std, not mean; two independently-seeded same-parameter ensembles
    (small per-point jitter) stay within the tolerance band (proves the tolerance is a real band,
    not exact equality); `"lane"` in `comparedAttributes` is skipped without throwing even absent a
    statistical tolerance entry for it; empty ensembles yield mean=std=0 without throwing; a
    `parityMode="statistical"` JSON round-trips through `MeanToleranceFor`/`StdToleranceFor`; an
    `exact` JSON still loads unchanged and `MeanToleranceFor` throws on it (no `Statistical` block).
    Full suite: 86 passed, 0 failed (up from 78) — all prior exact-mode tests (`TrajectoryComparatorTests`,
    every `Rung*ParityTests` real-golden test) verified unchanged and green.
  - **C1-iii. DONE ([net] golden regen, offline test). Statistical golden + parity test.** New
    scenario `scenarios/17-dawdle-freeflow` (single vehicle, `sigma=0.5`, free flow on a 2000m single
    lane so it never reaches the end within `end=80` → all runs fully present for clean pooling).
    Golden = a 24-run SUMO ENSEMBLE (`golden.ensemble/seed01..24.fcd.xml`, `sumo --seed 1..24
    --precision 6`), committed with `provenance.txt`. `tolerance.json` is `parityMode="statistical"`,
    `comparedAttributes=["speed"]` (pos excluded — a cumulative, non-stationary quantity), with
    `statistical.speed.mean=0.05`/`std=0.05`. Test `RungC1iiiStatisticalParityTests` parses the 24
    golden FCDs as the expected ensemble, runs the engine over 24 seeds as the actual ensemble, and
    asserts `TrajectoryComparator.CompareEnsemble` (C1-ii) `IsMatch`. **This is a real, tight test,
    not a loose one:** because C1-i ported SUMO's `dawdle2` ALGORITHM faithfully, the two ensembles
    (different RNG streams, same formula) converge to the same pooled speed distribution — observed
    at authoring **meanΔ=0.001140, stdΔ=0.003687 m/s**, so the committed 0.05 band is ~13–40× that
    noise floor yet far tighter than any real dawdle bug (a `sigma` factor-of-2 shifts the mean
    ~0.65 m/s). The RNG stream is NOT compared (the ensemble-not-RNG-exact decision). Golden regen
    (SUMO) was a deliberate `[net]` step; the committed goldens make the test run in the offline
    `dotnet test` loop with no SUMO. Full suite: 87 passed, 0 failed.

  Produces stop-and-go waves and realistic capacity. Prereq for C7 and for believable everything.
  **C1 (all three sub-rungs) is now DONE — the determinism-ladder gate is open; the statistical bar
  (ensemble/aggregate) is built and validated against SUMO.**
- **C2. Strategic (route-driven) lane changes + lane-to-lane continuity. The #1 lane-based realism
  gap.** Today a vehicle can sit in a lane that cannot reach its route. Port LC2013's STRATEGIC block
  (`LCA_STRATEGIC`/`LCA_URGENT`, `getBestLanes`/`bestLaneOffset` — `MSLCM_LC2013::_wantsChange` +
  `MSLane::getBestLanes`) so a vehicle moves into a lane that continues its route. Requires
  **lane-level** routing: honor `<connection fromLane/toLane>` turn permissions (B2 is edge-level).
  Parity axis. Reuses A2's neighbor query + the post-move LC phase.

  **ARCHITECTURAL FINDING (this session): C2 is the largest structural Group-C rung — it reworks the
  lane-sequence model.** Today `NetworkModel.ResolveLaneSequence` precomputes an EXACT lane path
  (`_laneSeqPool` slice) at insertion and THROWS if the depart lane has no `<connection>` to the next
  edge; `ExecuteMoves`'s lane-boundary advance blindly walks that precomputed sequence
  (`v.LaneSeqIndex++; v.LaneHandle = pool[start+index]`), while speed-gain/keep-right LC change
  `v.LaneHandle` to a neighbor WITHOUT updating the sequence. These never conflict today only because
  every multi-edge route is single-lane-per-edge (no LC) and every multi-lane scenario is single-edge
  (no advance). C2 is the first rung to combine multi-lane + multi-edge + lane choice, so the
  advance must follow the vehicle's ACTUAL current lane's connection, not a precomputed path — a
  change that touches the core every multi-edge parity scenario (9a/9b/A3) depends on. Gate HARD for
  byte-identical on those.

  **`[net]` anchor DONE: `scenarios/18-strategic-turnlane`** (committed golden). E1 (2 lanes, A→B,
  500m) → E2 (1 lane, B→C); ONLY `E1_1` (left) connects to E2 (via `:B_0_0`), `E1_0` (right) is a
  drop lane. `veh0` routes E1→E2 departing `E1_0`, so it MUST strategic-change left before B. Verified
  SUMO trajectory (`golden.fcd.xml`, `sigma=0`, seed 42): on `E1_0` through t≤16, strategic-changes to
  `E1_1` by t=17, crosses `:B_0_0` at t=38, reaches `E2_0` at t=39. Net built from committed
  `nodes.nod.xml`/`edges.edg.xml`/`connections.con.xml` via netconvert. `tolerance.json` exact,
  `["lane","pos","speed"]` @1e-3.

  **Suggested decomposition (engine work, offline against the anchor golden):**
  - **C2-i (additive, byte-identical). `getBestLanes` lane-continuity data. DONE.** Added
    `LaneContinuation(LaneIndex, AllowsContinuation, BestLaneOffset, Length)` +
    `NetworkModel.ComputeBestLanes(routeEdges, currentEdgeId)` in `src/Sim.Ingest/NetworkModel.cs`
    — a scoped port of `struct LaneQ` / `MSVehicle::updateBestLanes`
    (`sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicle.h:865-886`, `sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicle.cpp:5744-6063`), queried
    off the existing `ConnectionsByFromEdgeLane` table (no XML re-parse). **Scope: single
    look-ahead only** — current edge → the immediately next route edge; a lane "continues" iff it
    has any `<connection>` to that next edge; `Length` is always just the current edge's own
    length (never a route-wide sum). **Deferred**: SUMO's backward recursion
    (`MSVehicle.cpp:6003-6063`) that accumulates a continuing lane's `Length` across every
    remaining route edge — not needed until a multi-junction scenario requires it. **Sign
    convention**: `BestLaneOffset` positive = toward the LEFT, matching `Lane.LeftNeighbor` ==
    Index+1 (confirmed against SUMO's own `bestLaneOffset = bestThisIndex - index`,
    `MSVehicle.cpp:5973`, positive toward a higher lane index — same sense as this repo's
    left-is-higher-index convention). Unit test `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC2iBestLanesTests.cs`:
    on scenario 18's `E1` (route `E1 E2`), `E1_0` (drop lane) → `AllowsContinuation=false`,
    `BestLaneOffset=+1` (toward `E1_1`, confirmed to be `E1_0.LeftNeighbor`); `E1_1` →
    `AllowsContinuation=true`, `BestLaneOffset=0`; last route edge `E2` → every lane continues,
    offset 0. Inert-control proof on `11-priority-junction`'s single-lane-per-edge minor (`SJ JN`)
    and major (`WJ JE`) routes: every lane on every route edge has `BestLaneOffset=0` and
    `AllowsContinuation=true`, i.e. C2-ii built on this data is inert/byte-identical on every
    existing single-lane-per-edge parity scenario. Purely additive — touched only
    `src/Sim.Ingest/NetworkModel.cs` + the new test file; no simulation/engine/LC code path
    changed. Full suite: 93 passed, 0 failed (was 87; +6 new tests).
  - **C2-ii (behavioral, SUMO golden). Strategic LC + actual-lane advance. DONE.** Ported
    LC2013's STRATEGIC/URGENT block (`_wantsChange`, `sumo/src/microsim/lcmodels/MSLCM_LC2013.cpp`
    ~1216-1327, `currentDistDisallows` at `MSLCM_LC2013.h:189-191`) plus the entangled lane-sequence
    rework the briefing called out. Broke the old `v.LaneHandle`/`pool[LaneSeqIndex]` lockstep exactly
    per the 4-point design:
    1. **Pool = route path via the continuing/best lane.** `NetworkModel.ResolveLaneSequence` now
       resolves the FIRST edge's start lane via `ComputeBestLanes` (C2-i) instead of always using
       `departLaneIndex` literally: if the depart lane already `AllowsContinuation`, nothing changes
       (byte-identical fast path — covers every existing scenario); otherwise it starts from
       `departLaneIndex + BestLaneOffset` (the continuing lane `ComputeBestLanes` points at). Scenario
       18's pool resolves to `[E1_1, :B_0_0, E2_0]` — the old "no `<connection>` found from the depart
       lane" throw can no longer be reached via a non-continuing depart lane (unchanged for a
       genuinely unreachable route). `ResolveLaneSequenceHandles`/`TryInsertOnLane`/`UpdateReroutes`
       needed no changes (they already call `ResolveLaneSequence` internally).
    2. **Actual lane tracked separately — already true.** `TryInsertOnLane` already set
       `v.LaneId`/`v.LaneHandle` to the DEPART lane BEFORE calling `ResolveLaneSequenceHandles`, so
       once (1) changed what the pool resolves to, actual (`E1_0`) and pool[0] (`E1_1`) diverge
       automatically at insertion — no engine changes needed here.
    3. **Strategic LC** — new `Engine.TryStrategicLaneChange`, called from `DecideSpeedGainChanges`
       BEFORE the existing keep-right/speed-gain block (and `continue`s past speed-gain when it
       fires). Gated on `pool[LaneSeqIndex]`'s HANDLE differing from `v.LaneHandle` on the same edge —
       exactly the point-3 offset≠0 condition, and the gate that makes the whole method a no-op
       (not even touching the new `VehicleRuntime.LookAheadSpeed` field) for every existing scenario,
       since `NetworkModel.ResolveLaneSequence`'s own byte-identical fast path means the pool is
       always built from the depart lane there. Ported faithfully: `myLookAheadSpeed` growth/decay
       (`.cpp:1227-1236`), `laDist = myLookAheadSpeed·10·myStrategicParam(1.0)·(right?1:
       myLookaheadLeft(2.0)) + 2·lengthWithGap` (`.cpp:1238-1239`), `usableDist = curr.Length −
       posOnLane` (occupation/stop terms scoped to 0/unset — empty road, no stop on this edge) and
       the `currentDistDisallows` trigger (`.h:189`). `changeToBest`/`bestLaneOffset==curr.
       bestLaneOffset` collapse to trivially true because only the ONE direction `BestLaneOffset`'s
       own sign requires is ever evaluated (equivalent to SUMO's two-sided caller for this trigger).
       On commit: the SAME `IsTargetLaneSafe`/`TargetLaneBlockedByObstacle` veto A2/B5-ii use (clear
       road ⇒ never binding here), then a command-buffer `ChangeLane` lateral snap + `SpeedGainProbability`
       reset (`.cpp:1063/1080`).
    4. **Advance requires convergence.** `ExecuteMoves`' boundary-advance loop now checks
       `v.LaneHandle == pool[LaneSeqIndex]` before crossing to `pool[index+1]`; if not converged at
       the lane end, it clamps `Pos` to the lane length and zeroes `Speed` (stop at the lane end)
       instead of teleporting onto a route path this lane never connected to. Always true for
       single-lane-per-edge routes (pool built from the depart lane) ⇒ unexercised guard, but present
       for safety per the briefing.
    **One extra, empirically-necessary fix beyond the 4-point design:** after convergence (on `E1_1`,
    `bestLaneOffset=0`), the EXISTING (untouched) keep-right accumulator would have — per hand-derived
    arithmetic (`deltaProb≈0.138/step`, threshold `-2.0`) — spuriously fired ~14 steps later and moved
    the vehicle BACK onto the `E1_0` drop lane, contradicting the golden (which never returns to
    `E1_0`). Root cause (found by reading `MSLCM_LC2013.cpp:1398-1410`, the "opposite direction" STAY
    guard): real SUMO's `_wantsChange` returns early — BEFORE the keep-right accumulator is ever
    touched — once `currentDistDisallows(neighLeftPlace, |bestLaneOffset|+2, laDist)` holds, which for
    this net's numbers becomes true immediately upon convergence (`posOnLane > 188.2`, and the vehicle
    enters `E1_1` at `pos=205.68`). Ported the OBSERVABLE effect only (not the full early-return-
    before-accumulation semantics, since `KeepRightProbability` is not itself a compared golden
    attribute — only `lane`/`pos`/`speed` are): a new commit-time veto in `ApplyKeepRightDecision`,
    `LaneContinuesRoute(v, lane, rightLane.Index)` (a thin `ComputeBestLanes` wrapper, with a
    `route.Edges.Count <= 1` fast path that skips the call entirely for every single-edge scenario),
    ANDed into the existing `keepRightProbability * keepRightParam < -changeProbThresholdRight` commit
    gate. Verified inert for 06/07/12 (the only scenarios with a valid `RightNeighbor`) by exhaustive
    check: every scenario with multi-lane edges (06/07/12) is single-edge-route (`ComputeBestLanes`'
    own "last route edge" special case ⇒ `AllowsContinuation=true` for every lane, unconditionally),
    and every multi-edge scenario (9a/9b/A3/B3's 15-reroute) is single-lane-per-edge (`RightNeighbor`
    always `-1`, guard returns before this code is ever reached).
    **Byte-identical argument:** `TryStrategicLaneChange`'s gate (`pool[LaneSeqIndex]`'s handle ≠
    `v.LaneHandle`) is false for every existing scenario because C2-i already proved `BestLaneOffset`
    is 0 on every lane of every route edge for every single-lane-per-edge scenario, which is exactly
    what makes `ResolveLaneSequence`'s new continuing-lane resolution a no-op there (the depart lane
    always `AllowsContinuation`) — so the pool is unchanged, `ExecuteMoves`' new convergence check is
    always satisfied (actual always equals target), and the new keep-right veto's own fast path
    (`route.Edges.Count <= 1`) or unreachability (`RightNeighbor < 0`) makes it inert too. Full suite:
    **94 passed, 0 failed** (was 93; +1 new `RungC2ParityTests`); `Rung9aParityTests`/
    `Rung9bParityTests`/`RungA3ParityTests`/`RungA2ParityTests`/`Rung8bParityTests`/
    `Rung8aParityTests`/`RungC2iBestLanesTests` all re-verified green/unchanged in the same run.
    **Empirically confirmed trigger step** (temporary instrumentation, since removed): at `t=16`
    (post-move `pos=191.79`) `usableDist=304.21`, `laDist=292.8` (already saturated,
    `myLookAheadSpeed=13.89` since `t=6`) → `304.21 ≥ 292.8` → no change. At the next step
    (`pos=205.68`, emitted as `t=17`) `usableDist=290.32 < 292.8` → fires; golden shows `lane=E1_1`
    at `t=17` with `pos=205.68` unchanged (pure lateral snap) — exact match, pins the change at
    `t=17` as specified. Gated ACCEPT by parity-reviewer (byte-identity of the whole existing golden
    set proven, not merely within-tolerance, via a topology sweep: every existing scenario is either
    single-edge-route OR single-lane-per-edge, so all four modified mechanisms are provably inert).
    **FOLLOW-UP (non-blocking, from the C2-ii review):** the keep-right `LaneContinuesRoute` veto
    ports only the OBSERVABLE effect of `MSLCM_LC2013.cpp:1398-1410`'s STAY guard, not the full
    early-return-before-`myKeepRightProbability`-decrement. Latent gap (no committed golden exercises
    it): a FUTURE multi-edge route where a vehicle sits on a lane whose right neighbor does NOT
    continue the route would accumulate `KeepRightProbability` faster than SUMO (no early return) and
    could fire a keep-right change one-or-more steps early onto a lane that DOES continue. When the
    first such scenario lands (with its own golden), port the full early-return semantics (return
    before the accumulator decrement) instead of the commit-gate veto, and re-anchor 07/12
    byte-identical.
- **C3. Merging / on-ramp / zipper. DONE (exact parity @1e-3).** Minor-link CAUTIOUS APPROACH —
  the "slow to the stop line, then go once the gap is confirmed" half of the priority-junction
  mechanism that 9b did not cover (9b ported only yield-to-a-present-foe). Test:
  `RungC3OnRampMergeParityTests` (72 steps, `["lane","pos","speed"]` @1e-3, both vehicles full extent).

  **Scenario `scenarios/19-onramp-merge`** (committed golden, SUMO v1_20_0). Mainline `M` (A→J, 500m,
  priority 10) + ramp `R` (B→J, ~104m, priority 1) BOTH feed the same downstream lane `D_0`
  (`sameTarget` merge via `:J_1_0`/`:J_0_0`); junction J makes link 1 (M→D) major, link 0 (R→D) minor
  (`request index=0 response="10"`). `mA` (mainline, depart 0) + `rA` (ramp, depart 2), both at 13.89,
  `sigma=0`. SUMO: `rA` cruises `R` at 13.89, then DECELERATES near the junction (t=8: 11.906, t=9:
  7.406) toward the stop line, enters `:J_0_0` at t=10 (10.006), merges to `D_0` at t=11 and
  re-accelerates. `mA` is ~390 m away (pos 111 at t=8) — a HUGE gap — so `rA` is NOT gap-blocked; the
  slowdown is purely the cautious approach (a minor vehicle decelerates to be able to yield as it
  nears the junction, because it "cannot see" the foe lanes until within the link's foe-visibility
  distance, then re-accelerates once the gap is confirmed clear).

  **How it was resolved (this session):** the exact per-step speed is NOT a closed form derivable by
  static reading (documented dead-ends: it emerges from `planMoveInternal`'s `vLinkWait`/`opened()`
  path, not the `arrivalSpeed` cap). Built a `DEBUG_PLAN_MOVE` instrumented v1_20_0 Debug binary in a
  separate clone (`scripts/sumo-debug-instructions.md`), captured the `rA` trace, and read the exact
  internals. **The mechanism turned out simpler than the `arrivalSpeed` block suggested:** the actual
  per-step brake is just `vLinkWait = stopSpeed(speed, stopDist)` at `MSVehicle.cpp:2734`, with
  `stopDist = seen − laneStopOffset` and (minor arm, `.cpp:2656-2664`) `laneStopOffset` resolving to
  `POSITION_EPS` (0.1) since this net's lanes set no stop offset — i.e. plan to be able to stop AT the
  junction. The `arrivalSpeed`/`maxSpeedAtVisDist`/`maxArrivalSpeed` values feed only the
  arrival-TIME (`opened()`) decision, not the executed speed. Reproduced to <1e-3 from the trace:
  `stopSpeed(13.89, 22.22)=11.906333`, `stopSpeed(11.906333, 10.313667)=7.406333`; release at
  `seen(3.01) ≤ visibilityDistance(4.5)` → accelerate through.

  **Port:** a new arm in `Engine.JunctionYieldConstraint` (folded in, reusing the already-resolved
  ego-link / `<request>` / approach lane): when ego is on its approach lane and its link is minor
  (Response has any set bit ≡ `!havePriority()`) and `brakeDist < seen && seen > visibilityDistance`,
  contribute `stopSpeed(speed, seen − POSITION_EPS)` to the reducer; once `seen ≤ visibilityDistance`
  (4.5, the `NLHandler.cpp:1413` non-zipper default) it releases and free-flow/foe terms govern.
  `visibilityDistance` is a constant (no net attribute in scope). **Byte-identical elsewhere:** in
  `scenarios/11-priority-junction` a foe (vMajor) is approaching the whole time, so 9b's foe-scan
  already brakes vMinor to the SAME stop line (`stopDist == seen − POSITION_EPS`) — the two overlap
  at the identical `stopSpeed` (verified 9.433 at seen=14.9) and `Math.Min` changes nothing; far from
  the junction `stopSpeed` exceeds current speed (non-binding). `RungB5JunctionFoeTests`' two
  "lone-vMinor crosses" behavioral facts were updated: a lone minor vehicle now correctly performs
  the cautious dip (13.89→9.433→4.933, min 4.933, never a sustained stop) and crosses to `JN_0` at
  t=19 (was a naive free-cruise t=17) — the SAME golden-verified mechanism, and still cleanly
  differential vs. the external-agent FULL-halt fact (b).
- **C4. Remaining right-of-way: right-before-left, roundabouts, stop signs.** 9b did PRIORITY
  junctions only. Reuses 9b's `<request>` response/foe matrix + `opened()`. Parity axis, one
  scenario per RoW type. Goldens regenerated IN-SESSION (SUMO 1.20.0 is provisioned in the cloud
  env -- `sumo`/`netconvert` on PATH, version-matched to `SUMO_VERSION`, verified byte-for-byte
  against an existing committed golden before use).
  - **C4-i. DONE (no engine change). Right-before-left.** `scenarios/26-right-before-left`
    (`RungC4iRightBeforeLeftParityTests`, exact @1e-3). An uncontrolled symmetric cross (node type
    `right_before_left`); netconvert resolves it into a request matrix that is priority-like per
    vehicle (link 0 SJ->JN MAJOR `response="00"`, link 1 WJ->JE EQUAL state `=` `response="01"`),
    so vWest yields to vSouth (on its right). Because `JunctionYieldConstraint` is driven ENTIRELY
    by the `<request>` matrix, the 9b + C3 machinery reproduces the golden exactly with no new code
    (vSouth cruises; vWest cautious-approaches then junction-leader-follows across the crossing
    13.89->9.6097->5.1097). Anchors that the matrix-driven yield generalizes `m/M` -> `=/M`.
  - **C4-ii. DONE. All-way-stop.** `scenarios/27-allway-stop` (`RungC4iiAllwayStopParityTests`,
    exact @1e-3). Node type `allway_stop`, mutual `<request>` (each yields to the other, state
    `w`). Genuinely new mechanism vs priority/RBL: every approach must fully STOP first, then
    proceed in arrival order (longest waiter first) -- the pre-C4-ii engine DEADLOCKED here (mutual
    yield -> both halted forever). Port: `VehicleRuntime.WaitingTime` accrual in ExecuteMoves
    (MSVehicle::updateWaitingTime, `+= dt` while speed<=0.1 && accel<=0.5*maxAccel), and
    `Engine.AllwayStopConstraint` dispatched from `JunctionYieldConstraint` ONLY when
    `junction.Type=="allway_stop"` -- must-stop-first (`WaitingTime==0` => not open, MSLink.cpp:841)
    then proceed unless a responded foe is crossing now or has waited strictly longer
    (MSLink.cpp:940-945). Equal-wait arrivalTime tie-break approximated by link-index order
    (documented; not exercised -- scenario 27's waits differ by 3s). Byte-identical for every
    priority/RBL scenario (gated on junction.Type). Parity-reviewer ACCEPT (stash-test confirmed
    the deadlock without the change).
  - **C4-iii. DEFERRED -> needs the sameTarget-MERGE yield (see below).** A minimal roundabout was
    built (recipe + SUMO golden saved in the session scratchpad): a priority ring (circulating
    edges priority 10, approaches priority 1) -- netconvert makes each entry a standard minor link,
    so the entry cautious-approach/yield is just the existing machinery. BUT the roundabout entry
    is a `sameTarget` MERGE (the entering and circulating links share the ring's next lane), and the
    engine's `JunctionConflict` records only geometric CROSSINGS, not merges -- so with a
    circulating foe actually present, the entering vehicle does not follow-yield to it (it needs the
    merge-leader path). This is the gap-acceptance half of C3 that scenario 19 never exercised (mA
    was far). Blocked on that rung; the roundabout anchor lands once it exists.
  - **C4-iv. DONE (symmetric merge, exact @1e-3). sameTarget-merge yield (the C3 merge half).**
    `scenarios/31-merge-yield-sym` (`RungC4ivMergeYieldParityTests`, exact). A SLOW major vehicle mA
    crawls across the merge exactly as the minor vehicle vB arrives, so vB must follow-YIELD to mA
    onto the shared lane and then car-follow it (scenario 19's mA is far, so C3 never exercised
    this). Port = `Engine.SameTargetMergeConstraint`, VERIFIED per-step against the vendored v1_20_0
    `DEBUG_PLAN_MOVE_LEADERINFO` getLeaderInfo/adaptToJunctionLeader trace
    (`c4iv-merge-trace` on `pjanec/sumo`). Two phases (foe on its internal lane -> foe on the shared
    target lane), each a car-following LEADER; gap<0 -> stopSpeed to the junction entry; and the key
    gate -- the merge is NON-BINDING while ego is on its approach lane beyond foe-visibility (4.5) of
    the entry (SUMO's `MAX2(vSafeLeader, vLinkWait)` relaxation, MSVehicle.cpp:3478 -- the cautious
    approach governs there), binding only within visibility / on the internal lane. Byte-identical
    for every existing scenario incl. scenario 19/C3 (also a sameTarget merge but mA is never on the
    merge lane while rA is within visibility -> the arm returns +infinity). **Remaining
    refinement (asymmetric geometry):** `scenarios/29-merge-yield` (an ASYMMETRIC on-ramp: curved R
    vs straight M internal lanes) stays a NON-passing anchor -- its gap carries a
    `lengthBehindCrossing` term `(flbc - lbc) ~= -0.005` (angle-based `conflictSize`,
    MSLink.cpp:354-382) this port sets to 0; for the SYMMETRIC merge the two internal lanes are
    mirror images so that term cancels exactly (hence 31 is exact, 29 is off by 0.005 at
    firstDiv=t=12). Porting the merge conflict-geometry (from the traces' `lbc=`/`flbc=` values)
    would make 29 exact too and generalize to arbitrary merges; own small follow-on. The full
    two-phase mechanism + gating below was the hard part and is DONE.
    *(Original blocked-anchor note for `scenarios/29-merge-yield`, retained for context:)* A SLOW
    mainline vehicle mA (maxSpeed 6) crawls across the `:J_1_0` merge lane exactly when ramp vehicle
    rA arrives, so rA must follow-YIELD to mA onto the shared lane D.
    **Mechanism fully reverse-engineered this session** (from `MSLink::getLeaderInfo`,
    `sumo/src/microsim/MSLink.cpp:1349-1663`): a sameTarget pair (ego's + foe's connections feed the
    same `(To,ToLane)`) geometrically MERGES, not crosses, so no `JunctionConflict` is recorded --
    the foe is instead a car-following LEADER at the merge point (shared internal-lane end),
    crossingWidth forced to 0, gap = `distToMerge - egoMinGap - (foeInternalLaneLen - foeBackPos)`.
    Verified: the golden's first brake is `7.4063 -> 2.9063 == speed - maxDecel` (the negative merge
    gap drives max comfortable deceleration).
    **BOTH phases IMPLEMENTED this session, then REVERTED (parity bar -- converges but not
    1e-3-exact).** It is genuinely TWO mechanisms: (1) merge-leader while the foe is ON its internal
    lane -- `MSVehicle::adaptToJunctionLeader` with `distToCrossing==-1` (MSVehicle.cpp:3223-3239):
    `gap>=0` -> `followSpeed` against the foe; `gap<0` -> `stopSpeed(speed, seen - egoInternalLen -
    POSITION_EPS)` (stop before the junction entry, NOT raw followSpeed -- that was the first bug,
    it over-braked to 0); (2) **cross-lane leader following** once the foe moves onto the shared
    target lane while ego is upstream -- ego car-follows the rearmost vehicle currently on the target
    lane, gap = `distToMerge + (leaderPos - leaderLen) - egoMinGap`. With both, the whole trajectory
    TRACKS the golden and converges (asymmetric anchor 29: within ~0.005; symmetric anchor 31: within
    ~0.01 in the convergence tail). Two residuals block 1e-3, each needing the runtime trace to pin
    exactly:
      - **Conflict-geometry offset (anchor 29):** the gap is off by `egoLBC - foeLBC` (~0.0047) --
        the `lengthBehindCrossing` differs between the CURVED `:J_0_0` and STRAIGHT `:J_1_0`
        (angle-based `conflictSize`, MSLink.cpp:354-382, + `interpolateGeometryPosToLanePos` on the
        curve). ANCHOR 31 (`scenarios/31-merge-yield-sym`, a SYMMETRIC Y-merge with mirror-image
        internal lanes) was built precisely to make `egoLBC==foeLBC` cancel -- isolating this out.
      - **leaderBack / partial-occupancy (anchor 31):** at the step the foe FIRST enters the merge
        lane (front just past the start, back still on the previous edge), the engine's gap is ~5 m
        (~one vehicle length) SMALLER than SUMO's -- `getLeaderInfo`'s `leaderBack =
        getBackPositionOnLane` semantics for a vehicle spanning the lane boundary differ from the
        naive `pos - length`. This over-brakes ego for ~2 steps before reconverging.
    Net: mechanism + gap formulae are correct and committed as analysis; the two residuals are
    exactly the entangled runtime details a `DEBUG_PLAN_MOVE`/`getLeaderInfo`-gDebug trace resolves
    (the C3 situation -- build the instrumented v1_20_0 per `scripts/sumo-debug-instructions.md`,
    gate `DEBUG_COND` to the ramp vehicle, read the printed `getLeaderInfo` gap/leaderBack/
    distToCrossing per step). Two anchors (29 asymmetric, 31 symmetric) + goldens + this analysis
    committed. Own focused rung; unblocks C4-iii (roundabouts).
- **C5. Junction-blocking avoidance (`keepClear` / don't-block-the-box).** `MSLink::keepClear` + jam
  detection so a vehicle does not enter a junction it cannot clear. Prevents artificial gridlock /
  spillback across intersections. Parity axis; also a property test (junction never deadlocks).
  **SCOPING (this session):** the mechanism is `MSVehicle::checkRewindLinkLanes`
  (`sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicle.cpp:5025`, ~235 lines) -- the `myLFLinkLanes` downstream
  available-space accounting that reserves room on the exit lane before committing to a link, plus
  the `jm_ignore_keepclear_time` gate (`:7256`). This is the SAME next-lane/available-space
  machinery C4-iv phase-2 needs, and the engine has none of it today (no downstream-lane space
  lookup). Substantial own rung; needs a multi-vehicle downstream-jam scenario + almost certainly a
  DEBUG trace. SUMO is available in-session for golden regen.
- **C6. Actuated / adaptive traffic lights + yellow decision.** Rung 10 did STATIC `tlLogic` only.
  - **C6-i. DONE. Yellow decision ("stop if you can brake, else go").** `scenarios/30-yellow-decision`
    (`RungC6YellowDecisionParityTests`, exact @1e-3). Ported the `canBrakeBeforeStopLine` gate from
    MSVehicle.cpp:2754 (condition at :2648, `seen - stopOffset >= brakeDist`) into
    `Engine.RedLightConstraint`: a vehicle too close to a yellow/red light to stop in time PROCEEDS
    through the junction instead of emergency-braking (the dilemma-zone "go" decision), rather than
    always braking as rung 10 did. Scenario: scenario 09's TLS net, lane speed 25, a Green/yellow/red
    static program; veh0 hits yellow at seen 44 m < its 57.5 m braking distance and cruises through
    at 25 (the pre-C6 engine wrongly halted it at the stop line -- stash-test confirms). Byte-
    identical for rung 10 (scenario 09) and emergency-red (scenario 16): those vehicles always
    approach from far enough that the gate never fires. Parity-reviewer gated.
  - **C6-ii. TODO. Actuated / `delay_based` programs.** `MSActuatedTrafficLightLogic` is ~1436 lines
    with heavy induction-loop detector dependency (`MSInductLoop`, ~87 refs) -- the phase extension
    is driven by per-detector time-gaps, so this rung needs the detector subsystem modeled first
    (vehicle presence + time-since-detection per approach lane), then the gap-based `duration`/
    `maxDur` phase-switch logic. Large own rung. SUMO is available in-session for golden regen.
- **C7. `speedFactor` distribution (heterogeneous desired speeds).** Per-vehicle desired-speed
  variation (`speedFactor` = `normc(1.0, dev)`, `default.speeddev`); today everyone wants exactly the
  limit (mean 1.0, dev forced 0). Depends on C1 (seeded RNG). Statistical parity. Produces realistic
  speed spread and overtaking pressure.

  **Decomposed (like C1/B5/9b):**
  - **C7-i. DONE (OFFLINE, no SUMO). `speedFactor` sampler + per-vehicle draw.** New
    `NormcDistribution` (`src/Sim.Core/NormcDistribution.cs`), porting
    `Distribution_Parameterized::sample` (`sumo/src/utils/distribution/Distribution_Parameterized.cpp:107-120`,
    the `normc`/4-param `(mean,dev,min,max)` branch: `dev<=0` returns `mean` with NO draw at all;
    otherwise `randNorm` + a reject-resample `while(val<min||val>max)` clamp loop),
    `RandHelper::randNorm` (`sumo/src/utils/common/RandHelper.cpp:137-147`, the polar/Marsaglia
    method incl. the `ceil(log(q)*1e14)/1e14` quantized log term), and
    `MSVehicleType::computeChosenSpeedDeviation` (`sumo/src/microsim/MSVehicleType.cpp:89-91`:
    `roundDecimal(MAX2(minDev, sample), gPrecisionRandom)`). **Source correction (CLAUDE.md rule
    1):** `gPrecisionRandom` is **4**, not 6 as an earlier draft assumed — `sumo/src/utils/common/StdDefs.cpp:28`
    sets `int gPrecisionRandom = 4;` outright; ported from the source, not the stale assumption.
    `roundDecimal` (`StdDefs.cpp:52-56`, round-half-away-from-zero, NOT banker's rounding) ported
    verbatim as `NormcDistribution.RoundDecimal`. OWNER DECISION (mirrors C1): the distribution
    SHAPE is ported faithfully; the RNG STREAM is ours (`VehicleRng`/SplitMix64), never SUMO's
    RandHelper/MT19937.
    New `VehicleRng.SeedFor(globalSeed, entityIndex, salt)` 3-arg overload (`src/Sim.Core/VehicleRng.cs`)
    derives a SECOND, fully independent per-entity stream from the same `(Seed, entityIndex)` pair
    via an XOR salt — used ONLY for the once-at-creation `speedFactor` draw
    (`Engine.LoadScenario`, salt = the ASCII bytes of `"SpeedFac"` packed into a `ulong`), NEVER
    for `VehicleRuntime.RngState` (C1's per-step dawdle stream), so the two draws can never alias
    or steal from each other regardless of `default.speeddev`. New `VehicleRuntime.SpeedFactor`
    (plain `double`, D3-clean unmanaged field) holds the drawn value, computed ONCE at vehicle
    creation from `NormcDistribution.ComputeChosenSpeedDeviation(vType.SpeedFactor /*mean*/,
    ScenarioConfig.SpeedDev /*dev*/, min: 0.2, max: 2.0, ref speedFactorRng)` — `vType.SpeedFactor`
    is now purely the distribution MEAN fed into the sampler (still 1.0 for every existing
    scenario/vType), not the vehicle's actual desired-speed multiplier.
    `KraussModel.LaneVehicleMaxSpeed` gained a `speedFactor` parameter (`Math.Min(laneSpeed *
    speedFactor, vType.MaxSpeed)`); all four `Engine.cs` call sites (~817, 1727, 1728, 1879) now
    pass `v.SpeedFactor` instead of reading `vType.SpeedFactor` directly.
    **Byte-identical when `speeddev<=0`:** every existing scenario's `default.speeddev="0"` makes
    `NormcDistribution.SampleNormc`'s `dev<=0` branch return `mean` (1.0) immediately — no draw of
    any kind, from either RNG — so `v.SpeedFactor` is exactly `vType.SpeedFactor` (1.0) and
    `LaneVehicleMaxSpeed` is bit-for-bit its pre-C7 formula. Confirmed via the full `dotnet test`
    run (98 passed, 0 failed, up from 94) AND by name-checking `Rung1ParityTests`/
    `Rung9bParityTests` (real `golden.fcd.xml`/`tolerance.json` comparisons) still pass unchanged.
    New fixtures `scenarios/_fixtures/speedfactor-single-lane` (single vehicle, `sigma=0`,
    `default.speeddev=0.1`, isolating the speedFactor effect from dawdle) and
    `scenarios/_fixtures/speedfactor-independence` (a matched LOW-mean/HIGH-mean vType pair,
    `sigma=0.5`, `default.speeddev=0.05`, sharing one net/config) +
    `tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC7SpeedFactorTests.cs` (4 new behavioral/property tests, no
    golden): (1) `speeddev=0` control reaches exactly the lane free-flow speed, no draw; (2)
    same-seed determinism with `speeddev>0`; (3) a 50-seed ensemble of single-vehicle
    `sigma=0`/`speeddev=0.1` runs shows positive cross-seed variance in steady-state speed, a mean
    near the lane's free-flow speed, and every sample bounded by the `normc` clamp
    `[0.2*laneMax, 2.0*laneMax]`; (4) **C1 independence** — because
    `KraussModel.FinalizeSpeed`'s own formula reduces to `vMax = MaxNextSpeed(oldV)` (accel-only,
    target-independent) during the depart-from-rest accel ramp, a same-seed LOW-mean-target
    (~13.89 m/s) vs HIGH-mean-target (~25 m/s) run pair — otherwise identical vType/sigma, both
    with a REAL (`dev=0.05>0`) speedFactor draw — MUST produce byte-identical dawdle-perturbed
    speeds for t∈[1,3]s unless the speedFactor sampler's salted RNG leaked into `RngState`; the
    test asserts exactly that equality (and it holds, confirming the two streams never alias).
  - **C7-ii. DONE ([net] golden regen, offline test). SUMO ensemble golden + statistical parity
    test.** New scenario `scenarios/20-speedfactor-freeflow` (single vehicle, `default.speeddev=0.1`,
    `sigma=0` to isolate speedFactor, free flow on a 2000m lane). Golden = a 50-run SUMO ENSEMBLE
    (`golden.ensemble/seed01..50.fcd.xml`, `sumo --seed 1..50`), committed with `provenance.txt`.
    `tolerance.json` `parityMode="statistical"`, `comparedAttributes=["speed"]`,
    `statistical.speed.mean=0.7`/`std=0.2`. Test `RungC7iiStatisticalParityTests` runs the engine over
    50 seeds and asserts `CompareEnsemble` (C1-ii) `IsMatch`. **Result:** the ramp (0→steady) is
    byte-identical (accel 2.6); the pooled speed **std matches to Δ=0.046** (the discriminating check —
    spread == the 0.1 dev; `std` tol 0.2 catches a dev error >~7%), validating the distribution.
    The pooled **mean delta is 0.504** (the honest finite-ensemble sampling floor: two independent
    50-sample draws of `speedFactor~N(1,0.1)` have means bracketing 1.0 — SUMO 0.986, engine 1.023 —
    a ~0.51 m/s gap within 50-sample sampling error), covered by `mean` tol 0.7. Both deltas
    deterministic (fixed seeds + golden) so the test is stable. **C7 (both sub-rungs) DONE** — the
    speedFactor distribution is built and validated against SUMO. Full suite: 99 passed, 0 failed.
- **C8. Ballistic integration + `actionStepLength > 1` (reaction time).** SUMO's ballistic update
  (more accurate than Euler) and sub-second/multi-second reaction time. The integration method is
  already a config flag (DESIGN.md seam); this ports the ballistic `finalizeSpeed`/position update and
  the action-step sub-sampling. Parity axis — effectively a config variant of every scenario, so it
  needs its own goldens (ballistic on).
  - **C8-i. DONE (ballistic integration, free flow). `[net]` golden + offline test.** Ballistic
    (`step-method.ballistic=true`) differs from Euler ONLY in the position update: SUMO's trapezoidal
    `pos += 0.5*(oldSpeed + newSpeed)*dt` (the `!gSemiImplicitEulerUpdate` branch) vs Euler's
    `pos += newSpeed*dt`; the free-flow SPEED sequence is identical (accel-bounded). `ExecuteMoves`
    now branches on `_config.Ballistic` (capturing `oldSpeed` before the overwrite); **byte-identical
    to the old code when `Ballistic=false` (every existing scenario)**. New scenario
    `scenarios/21-ballistic-freeflow` (scenario 01's net, `ballistic=true`, single vehicle 0→13.89)
    + SUMO golden (verified t=1 pos 1.30 = 0.5·2.6·1, t=6 pos 45.945). Test `RungC8ParityTests`
    matches it to 1e-3. Full suite 100 green (99 Euler unchanged + this). **Deferred to C8-ii+**: the
    ballistic SAFE-SPEED branches (`maximumSafeStopSpeedBallistic`/`followSpeed`/`finalizeSpeed`
    ballistic) — they never bind free-flow; need a ballistic-with-leader scenario.
  - **C8-ii. DONE. `actionStepLength > 1` (reaction time).** `scenarios/28-actionstep`
    (`RungC8iiActionStepParityTests`, exact @1e-3, action-step-length=2). A vehicle re-plans its
    speed only every `actionStepLength` seconds; between action steps it CONTINUES with the
    acceleration decided at the last one (ported from MSVehicle.cpp:4443-4462 -- a non-action step
    skips `processLinkApproaches` and sets `vSafe = speed + accel*dt` with NO `finalizeSpeed`;
    isActionStep at MSVehicle.h:638). Port: `VehicleRuntime.LastActionTime` + an action-step gate at
    the top of `Engine.ComputeMoveIntent`, guarded by `actionStepLengthSecs > dt` so every prior
    scenario (all action-step-length=1) is byte-identical (the block is skipped entirely). The
    discriminating golden step: at the action step t=4 (speed 10.4) SUMO plans accel 1.745 to reach
    the 13.89 cap over the 2s interval and HOLDS it through the non-action step t=5 (12.145) into
    t=6 (13.89) -- every-step re-planning would instead give ~13.02 at t=6 (confirmed: stash-test
    fails at first-divergence t=6). NOTE (scoped): the isActionStep schedule is anchored for a
    depart-0 vehicle; per-vType action-step offsets and depart!=0 phase alignment are untested
    (no scenario needs them yet).
  - **C8-iii. TODO (optional). Ballistic car-following.** The ballistic safe-speed branches, with a
    ballistic-with-leader scenario, completing ballistic parity beyond free-flow.
- **C9. Cooperative lane changes.** LC2013's COOPERATIVE block (`LCA_COOPERATIVE` — make room for a
  blocked/merging neighbor). Depends on A2's neighbor query + C3 (merging pressure). Parity axis.
- **C10. Sublane / continuous lateral (SL2015). The lateral axis and the BRIDGE to navmesh/RVO.**
  Continuous lateral position (`minGapLat`, lateral speed, `latAlignment`), movement within and across
  lanes without discrete index snaps (`lanechange.duration>0` is the first step). Seam 2 (the lateral
  field, always-written-0 today) and seam 1 (neighbor query → spatial hash) were built precisely for
  this. Where it leaves SUMO's lane model it moves to a **behavioral** bar — and it is the natural
  meeting point with the navmesh/RVO continuous-movement layer (B4's U-turn, free-form avoidance).
  Large; its own phase. Ref `MSLCM_SL2015`, `MSLaneChangerSublane`.
- **C11. Alternative car-following models (IDM, ACC/CACC).** `MSCFModel_IDM`, `MSCFModel_ACC`,
  `MSCFModel_CACC` for modern / automated traffic. Each is a resolver dispatch (`carFollowModel`
  attribute) + a model port behind the same `KraussModel`-style constraint interface. Parity axis, one
  scenario per model.
  - **C11-i. DONE. IDM (Intelligent Driver Model).** Ported `sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/
    MSCFModel_IDM.cpp` (whole file, plain-IDM ctor arm — `myIDMM=false` — only; ACC/CACC/IDMM
    deferred, see below) as `src/Sim.Core/IdmModel.cs`: the iterated `_v` core (delta=4.0,
    iterations=`MAX2(1,int(TS/stepping(0.25)+.5))`=4 at dt=1s, `twoSqrtAccelDecel=2*sqrt(accel*decel)`,
    headwayTime=tau — the `myAdaptationFactor!=1` headway-scaling/level-of-service branches are
    provably dead for plain IDM, adaptationFactor hardwired to 1.0, and are omitted, not ported as
    no-ops); the four entry points `freeSpeed`/`followSpeed`/`stopSpeed`/`finalizeSpeed`
    (finalizeSpeed = the shared base `MSCFModel::finalizeSpeed` accel/decel-bound clamp with NO
    dawdle — IDM never overrides `patchSpeedBeforeLC`, whose base default is a plain `return vMax`);
    `getSecureGap`; and the `minNextSpeed` OVERRIDE (`MAX2(myDecel, MIN2(myEmergencyDecel,1.5))` —
    virtual-dispatched from both `MSCFModel::finalizeSpeed`'s own vMin term and
    `StopLineConstraint`'s `vMinComfortable`, not just the stopSpeed call).
    `carFollowModel` is now parsed from `<vType>` (`DemandParser`/`DemandModel.VType.CarFollowModel`)
    and resolved into `ResolvedVType.CarFollowModel` (`VTypeDefaults.Resolve`, default "Krauss"
    unchanged). `Engine.ComputeMoveIntent` dispatches per EGO vehicle (`vType.CarFollowModel=="IDM"`)
    at every constraint that computes ego's own car-following speed: `LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`,
    the free-flow desired-speed term (`FreeFlowDesiredSpeedConstraint`, new — IDM routes through
    `IdmModel.FreeSpeed` with `seen=+infinity`, i.e. the free-accel branch, since this engine has no
    "next lane's speed limit" lookahead for this term), `StopLineConstraint`, `RedLightConstraint`,
    `JunctionYieldConstraint`/`AdaptToJunctionLeader`, `ObstacleConstraint`, and the top-level
    `FinalizeSpeed` call — via two small dispatch wrappers (`FollowSpeedFor`/`StopSpeedFor`) whose
    Krauss arm is the EXACT pre-C11 `KraussModel.FollowSpeed`/`StopSpeed` call (same argument values,
    same order) — Krauss stays byte-identical (100 pre-existing parity tests unchanged, verified
    including `Rung1`/`Rung9b`/`RungB1`). New anchor: `scenarios/22-idm-carfollow`
    (`tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC11ParityTests.cs`, 60 steps, exact 1e-3) — both vTypes IDM, leader
    maxSpeed=6 free-accelerates, follower free-accelerates to ~13.7 then brakes via IDM's gap term
    and settles following the leader at the IDM equilibrium gap. **Deferred**: ACC/CACC (separate
    `MSCFModel_ACC`/`_CACC` ports), IDMM (`myIDMM=true`'s adaptation-factor/level-of-service state),
    and IDM+junction/stop interplay beyond what `stopSpeed`'s port itself guarantees (ported but only
    anchored by this rung's follow/free scenario, not exercised end-to-end by a junction golden yet).
  - **C11-ii. DONE. ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control).** Ported `sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/
    MSCFModel_ACC.cpp` (whole file) + `.h` (the `ACCVehicleVariables` state) as
    `src/Sim.Core/AccModel.cs`: the stateful `_v` control-mode machine (`accelSpeedControl` =
    `SC_GAIN(-0.4)*vErr`; `accelGapControl` selects gap/collision-avoidance/gap-closing mode by the
    `|spacingErr|<0.2 && |vErr|<0.1` / `spacingErr<0` thresholds, gains `GC=(0.07,0.23)`,
    `CA=(0.23,0.8)`, `GCC=(0.8,0.04)`; `_v` itself switches speed-control (`gap2pred>120`) vs.
    gap-control (`gap2pred<100`) vs., in the `[100,120]` hysteresis band, the vehicle's OWN
    *previous* mode — read/written via a per-vehicle `AccControlMode`/`AccLastUpdateTime` state
    pair, guarded by a "written at most once per timestep" `lastUpdateTime` check exactly like the
    vendored source); `followSpeed` (= `_v`'s result, overridden by `maximumSafeFollowSpeed()+2.0`
    — `EMERGENCY_THRESHOLD` — whenever that safety floor is more than 2.0 below it, reusing
    `KraussModel.MaximumSafeFollowSpeed` verbatim, not a distinct ACC safety formula); `stopSpeed`
    (provably the SAME formula as `MSCFModel_Krauss::stopSpeed`, so `AccModel.StopSpeed` is a thin
    pass-through to `KraussModel.StopSpeed`, not a duplicate). ACC does not override `freeSpeed` (the
    `FreeFlowDesiredSpeedConstraint` dispatch's existing non-IDM `else` arm — plain
    `laneVehicleMaxSpeed` — already covers it, no code change needed there) or `finalizeSpeed`/
    `patchSpeedBeforeLC` (inherits the base class's dawdle-free clamp, i.e. the SAME formula
    `IdmModel.FinalizeSpeed` already ports — `Engine.ComputeMoveIntent`'s dispatch now reads
    `v.VType.CarFollowModel is "IDM" or "ACC"` for that one line). **STATE**: `VehicleRuntime` gained
    `AccControlMode`(int)/`AccLastUpdateTime`(double), both default 0 (matching
    `ACCVehicleVariables`' own ctor default), written ONLY by the owning vehicle from inside
    `AccModel.FollowSpeed`, threaded `ref` through `FollowSpeedFor`'s three call sites
    (`LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`, `ObstacleConstraint`, `JunctionYieldConstraint`/
    `AdaptToJunctionLeader` — all three now also thread `time`, the Plan-phase per-step timestamp,
    as the analog of `MSNet::getCurrentTimeStep()`) — parallel-safe under `UseParallelPlan` by the
    same per-entity-write argument as C1's dawdle-RNG mutation (that property's own header comment).
    Krauss/IDM stay byte-identical: the two new `FollowSpeedFor` parameters are simply threaded
    through unread/unwritten by their arms (100 pre-C11-ii parity tests unchanged, including
    `Rung1`/`Rung9b`/`RungA2`/`RungB1`/`RungC11ParityTests` (IDM) — verified, plus the pre-existing
    IDM anchor scenario 22). New anchor: `scenarios/23-acc-carfollow`
    (`tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC11AccParityTests.cs`, 70 steps, exact 1e-3) — both vTypes ACC,
    leader maxSpeed=6 departs at pos 140 (initial gap ~132.5 > 120 → follower does SPEED CONTROL),
    transitions through the 100-120 HYSTERESIS band, then GAP CONTROL (<100), settling behind the
    slow leader. **Deferred**: CACC (`MSCFModel_CACC`, now done — see C11-iii below), and
    ACC+junction/stop interplay beyond what the ported `stopSpeed`/`AdaptToJunctionLeader`
    plumbing itself guarantees (not exercised end-to-end by a junction golden yet).
  - **C11-iii. DONE. CACC (Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control).** Ported
    `sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/MSCFModel_CACC.cpp` (whole file, CACC_NO_OVERRIDE
    `CommunicationsOverrideMode` path only) + `.h` (the `CACCVehicleVariables` state) as
    `src/Sim.Core/CaccModel.cs`: the stateful, COOPERATIVE `_v` (time-gap-based mode select —
    `timeGap>2`→speed control, `timeGap<1.5`→gap control (`speedGapControl`), `[1.5,2]`
    hysteresis→the vehicle's OWN previous `CaccControlMode`) and `speedGapControl` (no
    leader→`speedSpeedControl`; leader NOT CACC→ACC fallback calling `AccModel.V` — widened from
    `private` to `internal` — DIRECTLY, not `AccModel.FollowSpeed`, with `headwayTime=
    HEADWAYTIME_ACC=1.0`, not `vType.Tau`; leader IS CACC→the cooperative law
    `spacingErr=gap-tau*speed`, `speedErr=predSpeed-speed+tau*egoAcceleration`, gap/collision-
    avoidance/gap-closing sub-modes selected by the `0<spacingErr<0.2 && vErr<0.1` /
    `spacingErr<0` thresholds, gains `GC=(0.45,0.0125)`, `CA=(0.45,0.05)`, `GCC=(0.005,0.05)`);
    `followSpeed` (= `_v`'s result, overridden by `maximumSafeFollowSpeed(...,onInsertion:true)+2.0`
    whenever that safety floor is more than 2.0 below it — `onInsertion=true` here, UNLIKE ACC's own
    `followSpeed`, which omits the argument); `stopSpeed` (provably the same formula as
    Krauss/ACC's own, so `CaccModel.StopSpeed` is a thin pass-through, not a duplicate). CACC does
    not override `freeSpeed` (beyond a debug-only `caccVehicleMode` side-effect, not ported — no
    behavior change) or `finalizeSpeed`/`patchSpeedBeforeLC` (inherits the same base-class
    dawdle-free clamp ACC/IDM already route through — `Engine.ComputeMoveIntent`'s dispatch now
    reads `v.VType.CarFollowModel is "IDM" or "ACC" or "CACC"` for that one line).
    **STATE — the key subtlety**: `MSCFModel_CACC.h`'s `CACCVehicleVariables` literally
    *inherits* `MSCFModel_ACC::ACCVehicleVariables` rather than declaring its own
    `ACC_ControlMode`/`lastUpdateTime` copies, and CACC's own outer `_v` guard
    (`vars->lastUpdateTime`) and its embedded ACC-fallback call (`acc_CFM._v(veh,...)`, reading
    the SAME `veh`'s SAME inherited field) share that ONE physical field — confirmed by reading
    `createVehicleVariables()`, which initializes `ACC_ControlMode=0`/`lastUpdateTime=0` alongside
    `CACC_ControlMode=0` on a single allocated object. Ported literally: `VehicleRuntime` gained
    only ONE new field, `CaccControlMode` (int, default 0) — the ACC-fallback state REUSES this
    vehicle's own pre-existing `AccControlMode`/`AccLastUpdateTime` (C11-ii) rather than adding a
    redundant, behaviorally-divergent `CaccLastUpdateTime` (a separate field would silently break
    the real cross-call guard interaction: CACC's outer `_v` stamps `lastUpdateTime` to the current
    step BEFORE calling into the ACC fallback in the same call, making the fallback's OWN guard see
    an already-current timestamp and skip its mode rewrite that step — exactly reproduced by
    sharing the field, broken by not sharing it). No collision with an actually-ACC-typed vehicle:
    `CarFollowModel` is fixed at one string per vehicle, so a vehicle is never dispatched through
    both `AccModel.FollowSpeed` and `CaccModel.FollowSpeed`. **EGO-ACCELERATION**: CACC's
    cooperative law reads `veh->getAcceleration()` — the ego's own acceleration from the LAST
    COMPLETED step — ported as a new `VehicleRuntime.Acceleration` (double, default 0), written
    unconditionally in `Engine.ExecuteMoves` right next to the pre-existing `oldSpeed` capture
    (`v.Acceleration = (v.Intent.NewSpeed - oldSpeed) / dt`) and read only by CACC's cooperative
    branch in the FOLLOWING step's Plan phase — consistent with the frozen-start-of-step-snapshot
    invariant, and read-by-nothing-but-CACC for every other vType. Both new state fields are
    threaded `ref`/by-value through `FollowSpeedFor`'s three call sites
    (`LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`, `ObstacleConstraint`, `JunctionYieldConstraint`/
    `AdaptToJunctionLeader`), which now also pass `hasPred`/`predIsCacc` (the leader's/foe's own
    `VType.CarFollowModel=="CACC"`; always `false` for a B1 `ExternalObstacle`, which has no
    `CarFollowModel` at all). Krauss/IDM/ACC stay byte-identical: the four new `FollowSpeedFor`
    parameters and the `ExecuteMoves` `Acceleration` write are threaded/written unconditionally but
    read ONLY by the CACC arm (103 pre-C11-iii parity tests unchanged, including
    `Rung1`/`Rung9b`/`RungA2`/`RungB1`/`RungC11ParityTests` (IDM)/`RungC11AccParityTests` (ACC) —
    verified). New anchor: `scenarios/24-cacc-carfollow`
    (`tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC11CaccParityTests.cs`, 70 steps, exact 1e-3) — both vTypes CACC,
    leader maxSpeed=6; follower free-accelerates under speed control, transitions through the
    1.5-2.0s time-gap HYSTERESIS band, then COOPERATIVE gap control (leader IS CACC, so the ACC
    fallback is never actually exercised by this golden — ported and cited but unreached by this
    anchor), settling at the tight CACC cooperative gap. **Deferred**: the
    `CACC_MODE_NO_LEADER`/`CACC_MODE_LEADER_NO_CAV`/`CACC_MODE_LEADER_CAV`
    `CommunicationsOverrideMode` branches (unreachable — no vType/param in this engine's ingest
    ever sets `CACC_CommunicationsOverrideMode` away from its `CACC_NO_OVERRIDE` ctor default),
    the ACC-fallback path end-to-end (ported, but not exercised by any committed golden — needs a
    mixed CACC-follows-non-CACC scenario), and CACC+junction/stop interplay beyond what the ported
    `stopSpeed`/`AdaptToJunctionLeader` plumbing itself guarantees.
  - **C11-iv. DONE. IDMM (IDM with Memory / "Improved IDM").** SUMO builds IDMM from the SAME
    `MSCFModel_IDM` class as plain IDM, just with its `idmm=true` ctor arm
    (`sumo/src/microsim/cfmodels/MSCFModel_IDM.cpp:37-47`): `myAdaptationFactor=1.8`,
    `myAdaptationTime=600` (plain IDM: `1.0`/`0.0`), plus a per-vehicle
    `VehicleVariables::levelOfService` (`.h:189-194`, ctor-defaulted to `1.0`, NOT `0`). Two
    `myAdaptationFactor != 1.` branches only IDMM ever takes: (1) `_v`'s headway adaptation
    (`.cpp:203-207`) — `headwayTime = tau * (myAdaptationFactor + levelOfService*(1-
    myAdaptationFactor))`, i.e. `tau * (1.8 - 0.8*LOS)` for IDMM, used everywhere `_v` used plain
    `tau`; (2) `finalizeSpeed`'s memory update (`.cpp:67-74`) — AFTER the base (unmodified)
    `vNext = MSCFModel::finalizeSpeed(...)`, `levelOfService += (vNext/laneMaxSpeed -
    levelOfService)/600*TS`. Ported WITHOUT touching `IdmModel.cs`'s existing plain-IDM body at
    all (byte-identical proof, not just an argument): `IdmModel.V`/`FollowSpeed`/`FreeSpeed`/
    `StopSpeed` each gained an **optional** `double? headwayTimeOverride = null` parameter —
    inside `V`, `headwayTime = headwayTimeOverride ?? vType.Tau`; every pre-existing IDM/ACC/CACC
    call site passes nothing, so this resolves to the exact literal `vType.Tau` these functions
    always used. `IdmModel.FinalizeSpeed`'s body is untouched (no `ref levelOfService` parameter
    added there at all) — the LOS memory update is applied by the CALLER
    (`Engine.ComputeMoveIntent`'s IDMM dispatch arm) immediately after that call returns
    `newSpeed`, mirroring the vendored source's own sequencing (base finalizeSpeed first, then the
    memory update) without growing the shared function's signature. `GetSecureGap` is
    DELIBERATELY left unadapted (`MSCFModel_IDM::getSecureGap`, `.cpp:190-193`, always uses the
    plain unadapted `myHeadwayTime` member, never `levelOfService`, even for IDMM — ported
    faithfully as-is, not an oversight). New `src/Sim.Core/IdmmModel.cs` holds only the two small
    IDMM-specific pieces (`AdaptationFactor=1.8`/`AdaptationTime=600.0` constants,
    `AdaptedHeadwayTime(tau, los)`, `UpdateLevelOfService(los, vNext, laneMaxSpeed, dt)`) — no
    duplicate `_v`/finalizeSpeed body. **STATE**: `VehicleRuntime.LevelOfService` (double), set to
    `1.0` for EVERY vehicle at creation (`Engine.LoadScenario`, matching the vendored ctor
    default) — harmless/inert for non-IDMM vTypes since only the IDMM dispatch arms below ever
    read or write it, the exact same per-entity plan-phase-mutation pattern C1's `RngState` /
    C11-ii's `AccControlMode` / C11-iii's `CaccControlMode` already establish as parallel-safe.
    **Dispatch** (`Engine.cs`): `FollowSpeedFor`/`StopSpeedFor` gained a `levelOfService`
    parameter (read-only, ONLY consumed by their new `"IDMM"` arms to build
    `IdmmModel.AdaptedHeadwayTime(vType.Tau, levelOfService)` and pass it as
    `headwayTimeOverride`), threaded from every one of their six/three call sites as the ego's own
    `v.LevelOfService`/`ego.LevelOfService`; `FreeFlowDesiredSpeedConstraint` gained its own
    `"IDMM"` arm computing the same override inline (it already has direct `VehicleRuntime`
    access); the `vMinComfortable`/`minNextSpeed` dispatch (`StopLineConstraint`) simply added
    `"IDMM"` alongside `"IDM"` to its existing check — `minNextSpeed` (`.cpp:52-62`) has NO
    `myAdaptationFactor`/`levelOfService` term at all, so IDMM shares the identical
    `IdmModel.MinNextSpeed` call, no override needed; the `FinalizeSpeed` dispatch
    (`ComputeMoveIntent`) added `"IDMM"` alongside `"IDM" or "ACC" or "CACC"` (same
    `IdmModel.FinalizeSpeed` call, byte-identical body) and then, ONLY for `"IDMM"`, updates
    `v.LevelOfService = IdmmModel.UpdateLevelOfService(v.LevelOfService, newSpeed,
    laneVehicleMaxSpeed, dt)` right after. Krauss/IDM/ACC/CACC stay byte-identical: every new
    parameter/field is threaded/written unconditionally but read only by the `"IDMM"` arms (104
    total parity tests, 0 failed — including `Rung1`/`Rung9b`/`RungC11ParityTests` (IDM)/
    `RungC11AccParityTests`/`RungC11CaccParityTests` all unchanged/green — verified). New anchor:
    `scenarios/25-idmm-carfollow` (`tests/Sim.ParityTests/RungC11IdmmParityTests.cs`, 250 steps,
    exact 1e-3) — a LONG 3000m single lane so the follower stays in sustained congestion behind
    the slow (maxSpeed=6) leader long enough for `levelOfService` to actually drift (600s
    time-constant); at LOS=1.0 IDMM==IDM exactly, and as the follower settles into congestion the
    steady-state gap visibly GROWS over the run (~8.81m@t60 → ~9.52m@t249 in the golden), the
    discriminating memory effect this anchor exercises. This completes the IDM/ACC/CACC/IDMM
    car-following-model set (all four now ported).
- **C12. Pedestrians & crossings; public transport.** Pedestrians already appear as junction foes in
  the ported `getLeaderInfo` (the `leader==nullptr` ped branch); add vehicles yielding at crosswalks,
  and bus stops / dwell times / schedules. Breadth; behavioral, with parity where a SUMO analog exists
  (`MSPModel`, `<busStop>`).

**Suggested realism order:** **C1** (unblocks realism) → **C2** (correct multi-lane routing) →
**B5** (external-agent interop, the project's stated direction) → C3/C4 (merges + the rest of RoW) →
C5/C6 (junction blocking + actuated TLs) → C7/C9 (speed spread + cooperative LC) → C8/C11 (integration
+ CF models) → C10 (sublane/continuous → navmesh bridge) → C12 (peds/PT). C1 and C2 are the two
highest-leverage items; B5 is the one that directly serves "lane traffic respects navmesh/RVO agents."

## Group D — FastDataPlane ECS readiness (characterized, not yet briefed)

**Goal — READINESS, NOT INTEGRATION (owner's clarification).** Make the engine FDP-*shaped* so it
could later drop into the owner's own ECS library derived from **FastDataPlane**
(`github.com/pjanec/FastDataPlane`, namespaces `Fdp.Core`/`Fdp.ModuleHost`) — WITHOUT adding any
`FastDataPlane` dependency or wiring its network layer now. Everything here is in-house: the
representation refactor (int handles, unmanaged-style component structs, zero-alloc hot path,
command-buffer lifecycle, phased systems, parallelizable) plus thin SEAMS (D7/D9) that make an
`Fdp.Core` backend / info-replication a later drop-in. This is a representation refactor, NOT a
behavior change: the **committed parity/behavioral tests are the oracle** — every D-rung must leave
them byte-identical (`dotnet test` green), exactly like the inert-when-absent discipline used
throughout, and each re-runs the D1 benchmark to record its alloc/throughput delta.

**FDP conventions to target** (from its `Docs/architectural-rules.md` + `USER-GUIDE-OVERVIEW.md`):
- `Entity` = struct handle (`Index`:32 + `Generation`:16). Never store raw ints; gate stored handles
  on `World.IsAlive(e)`.
- Components = **unmanaged value structs** in fixed-size chunks (SoA); NO managed/reference fields.
- Queries = `world.Query().With<A>().With<B>().Build()` + `GetComponentRW<T>`/`GetComponentRO<T>`.
- Systems = phases `SystemPhase.{Input,BeforeSync,Simulation,PostSimulation,Export}`, ordered via
  `[UpdateBefore]`/`[UpdateAfter]`; module systems (`IModule`) run **async** in `Simulation`.
- **Zero-alloc hot path**: no LINQ/`new`/boxing in `OnUpdate`; use `foreach` queries, `stackalloc`,
  `Span<T>`, pre-allocated `NativeArray<T>`. (Spawning is "cold path" — allocation allowed there.)
- Structural changes via `view.GetCommandBuffer()` → `cmd.AddComponent<T>()`/`DestroyEntity()`.
- Determinism via `GlobalTime`/`DeltaTime` (never `DateTime`/`Stopwatch`); `HasAuthority<T>` for split
  authority; static blueprints live in `TkbDatabase`; network via `NetworkEntityMap` /
  `INetworkIdAllocator` / `IDescriptorTranslator`.

**Concept mapping (this engine → FDP):**
| This engine | FDP concept |
|---|---|
| `Kinematics`, `MoveIntent` (already structs) | ECS components (unmanaged) |
| `VehicleRuntime` (class, managed fields) | **must decompose** into component structs + `Entity` |
| `NetworkModel`, `ResolvedVType`, `Route` (immutable) | **TKB descriptors** (static blueprints) |
| seam-4 deferred lane swaps / reroute / insertion | `GetCommandBuffer()` (AddComponent/DestroyEntity) |
| Insert / Emit / Plan / Execute / DecideLaneChanges / UpdateReroutes passes | `SystemPhase` systems |
| frozen-snapshot plan (RO reads, own RW write) | async `Simulation` module systems |
| no `System.Random` / no wallclock (already) | FDP determinism rule (`GlobalTime`) — already satisfied |

**Already aligned (the hard, load-bearing parts):** deferred command-buffer discipline, phase-based
passes, order-independent frozen-snapshot plan/execute, value-type components, immutable blueprints,
and determinism (no RNG/wallclock). **The gap is representation, not architecture.**

- **D1. Many-vehicle benchmark scenario + baseline harness. DONE.** `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense`
  (3-lane, 5 km, 420 vehicles, ~20 % slow so LC/neighbor/reducer hot paths fire; NO golden) +
  `src/Sim.Bench` console harness (steps/sec, alloc/step, GC, peak concurrency, determinism hash — NOT
  in `dotnet test`) + `RungD1BenchmarkDeterminismTests` (a fast offline guard that two dense runs are
  byte-identical). **Baseline (current AoS/LINQ engine, 500 steps, 378 peak concurrent): 1284 steps/s
  (0.779 ms/step), 80.9 MiB total, ~736 B/veh-step, deterministic=True.** See
  `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense/BASELINE.md`. The ~736 B/veh-step is the D2–D4 target; the
  deterministic=True at load is the invariant D8 parallelization relies on. `dotnet test` = 62 green.
- **D2. Int-handle identity (strings → dense indices). DONE.** `Lane` gained a global dense `int
  Handle`; `NetworkModel` exposes `LanesByHandle`/`LaneHandleById` + `ResolveLaneSequenceHandles`;
  `VehicleRuntime` gained `LaneHandle`/`LaneSequenceHandles` (parallel to the string `LaneId`/
  `LaneSequence`, kept for the FCD/obstacle/router boundary); `LaneNeighborQuery` buckets are keyed by
  `int` handle (array-indexed, not string-hashed); per-vehicle hot-path lane lookups use
  `LanesByHandle[handle]`. Pure refactor — trajectory hash UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59` before/after),
  `dotnet test` = 62 green. Alloc drop modest (~0.7 B/veh-step; D2 removes string hashing, not the
  allocations — that's D4) but it's the prerequisite for D3 (unmanaged component `int[]` LaneSequence)
  and D4 (handle-indexed reusable buckets). Benchmark row appended to BASELINE.md.
- **D3. Move managed/variable-length state off the entity. DONE.** The real FDP-readiness gap was the
  three managed collections on the `VehicleRuntime` class; they now live in ENGINE side storage keyed
  by a stable `EntityIndex`: `LaneSequence`(string) + `LaneSequenceHandles`(int[]) → a shared
  `_laneSeqPool` (`List<int>`) with a per-entity `[LaneSeqStart, LaneSeqLen)` slice (blob-style; a
  reroute appends a new slice); `Stops` (`Queue`) → `_stopsByEntity` (populated only for vehicles with
  stops); `AvoidedEdges` (`HashSet`) → `_avoidedByEntity` (lazily, only for rerouted vehicles). The
  entity now holds ONLY unmanaged scalars/structs (`Kinematics`, `MoveIntent`, `int`/`double`/`bool`)
  + the two IMMUTABLE blueprint refs (`Def`, `VType`) — verified: no `Queue`/`HashSet`/`IReadOnlyList`/
  `int[]` field remains. Pure refactor — hash UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59`), `dotnet test` = 62 green
  (incl. the stop + reroute suites that exercise the side tables). Alloc unchanged on the bench
  (no stops/reroute there) — the win is representational (chunk-storable entity). **Deferred to D7's
  store boundary** (kept low-risk here): grouping the flat scalars into sub-structs (`RouteProgressC`/
  `LcStateC`/…) and turning `Def`/`VType` into TKB handles.
- **D4. Allocation-free hot path. DONE.** Reducer `new List<double>{…}.Min()` → running `Math.Min`
  over the same six constraints (same order); `LaneNeighborQuery` from a per-step `Build` factory →
  ONE reused instance with `Refill()` (pre-allocated per-lane buckets `Clear()`ed + refilled in place,
  zero steady-state alloc, both pre- and post-move snapshots); junction `Requests`/`Conflicts`
  `FirstOrDefault` → plain `foreach`; left/right neighbor-lane LINQ scans → O(1) `Lane.LeftNeighbor`/
  `RightNeighbor` handles precomputed at ingest. Pure refactor — hash UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59`),
  `dotnet test` = 62 green. **alloc/veh-step 735.8 → 207.1 B (−71.9%)**, GC gen0 5 → 2. The remaining
  ~207 B is the `TrajectorySet`/FCD emit (a `TrajectoryPoint` + `SortedDictionary` insert per veh-step)
  — an output-contract allocator, out of D4 scope; it moves to a reusable buffer when the emit becomes
  an Export-phase system (D6). Benchmark row in BASELINE.md.
- **D5. Entity handle + command-buffer structural mutations. DONE.** `Entity(int Index, int
  Generation)` (FDP's handle shape; `Generation` reserved at 0) on every `VehicleRuntime`; a reusable
  `CommandBuffer` (`ChangeLane`/`ReplaceRoute`/`Destroy`/`Flush`, zero steady-state alloc). The deferred
  structural mutations now record into the buffer and flush at their existing phase barriers — reroute
  route-replacement (end of `UpdateReroutes`), arrival = `Destroy` (end of `ExecuteMoves`), and the
  speed-gain lane swap (end of the post-move LC phase). The **keep-right** swap was deliberately kept
  INLINE (documented): the speed-gain decision re-reads that same vehicle's lane in the same iteration
  right after it — a genuine same-phase read-after-write a barrier flush can't honor, so correctness
  beats FDP-purity there. Pure refactor — hash UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59`), `dotnet test` = 62 green,
  alloc unchanged (~206 B/veh-step). Index-recycling / generation-bumping deferred to D7's store
  boundary. Benchmark row in BASELINE.md.
- **D6. Restructure the step loop into phased systems over queries. DONE.** `SystemPhase.cs`
  (`Input`/`Simulation`/`PostSimulation`/`Export`) + `VehicleQuery.cs` (`ActiveVehicleQuery`, a
  zero-alloc hand-written struct enumerator yielding `Inserted && !Arrived` vehicles — the FDP
  `Query()` analog). Every hot-path `foreach(_vehicles){if(!Inserted||Arrived)continue;…}` now reads
  `foreach (var v in ActiveVehicles())`. `Run()`'s per-step body keeps its exact order with
  `// [SystemPhase.X]` tags: Input=`InsertDepartingVehicles`,`UpdateReroutes`; Export=`EmitTrajectory`
  (stays between Insert and Simulation — emits the prior step's settled result; the emit-before-plan
  `time+dt` timing is load-bearing, NOT moved); Simulation=`PlanMovements` (RO frozen-snapshot reads,
  own-`MoveIntent` writes); PostSimulation=`ExecuteMoves`,`DecideSpeedGainChanges`. Pure refactor —
  hash UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59`), `dotnet test` = 62 green, query is zero-alloc (bench 205.9 B/
  veh-step, no GC increase). The `TrajectorySet` emit alloc is left for D9's export seam. Baseline row
  appended.
- **D7. The FDP-shaped seam / adapter (READINESS — NO `Fdp.Core` dependency). DONE.**
  `ICommandBuffer` (`ChangeLane`/`ReplaceRoute`/`Destroy`/`Flush`, the FDP `view.
  GetCommandBuffer()` -> deferred `AddComponent`/`DestroyEntity` analog) — D5's `CommandBuffer`
  now `: ICommandBuffer`, same four method bodies, unchanged. `IWorld` (`GetCommandBuffer()` +
  `ActiveVehicles()`) — the FDP `World`/`View` surface scoped to what this engine needs: a way to
  reach the command buffer and a way to reach the "active, on-road vehicle" query (D6's
  `Query()` analog). `IQuery` is deliberately NOT a separate interface: `IWorld.ActiveVehicles()`
  returns the concrete `ActiveVehicleQuery` struct BY VALUE (a factory method), not an `IQuery`/
  `IEnumerable<VehicleRuntime>` — FDP's own query surface is struct-based for the same reason
  (boxing the enumerator behind an interface would allocate every vehicle, every step, undoing
  D4's alloc work). One in-house backend, `World` (`src/Sim.Core/World.cs`), wraps the SAME
  `List<VehicleRuntime>`/`CommandBuffer` instance `Engine` already owned (D3–D6) — no state moved,
  no computation added. `Engine` now holds `_world` (`IWorld`) and `_commandBuffer`
  (`ICommandBuffer`, cached once from `_world.GetCommandBuffer()` in a new constructor so every
  EXISTING `_commandBuffer.X(...)` call site is untouched); `ActiveVehicles()` now reads
  `_world.ActiveVehicles()` instead of constructing `new(_vehicles)` directly. New files:
  `ICommandBuffer.cs`, `IWorld.cs`, `World.cs`. Pure representation refactor — hash UNCHANGED
  (`909605E965BFFE59` in both single-threaded `hashA` and parallel `hashPar`), `dotnet test` = 63
  green, alloc/veh-step unchanged (206.1 B single / 214.4 B parallel, matching D6/D8's
  205.9 B/~206–215 B range — no boxing, no new per-step allocation). This is the drop-in point —
  an `Fdp.Core`-backed `IWorld` implementation could be added LATER by the owner without touching
  any system in `Engine.cs`, but this project does NOT add the `FastDataPlane` reference or write
  that backend. Benchmark row in BASELINE.md. (When the owner later wires `Fdp.Core`, read
  `Engine/Fdp.ModuleHost` + `Engine/Examples` for the exact `IModule`/registration signatures.)
- **D8. Parallelize the Simulation phase. DONE.** `Engine.UseParallelPlan` (default `false`,
  opt-in): when `true`, `PlanMovements` iterates `_vehicles` via `System.Threading.Tasks.
  Parallel.For(0, _vehicles.Count, i => {...})` (guarded per-index by the same `Inserted &&
  !Arrived` predicate `ActiveVehicleQuery` applies) instead of the sequential `foreach (var v in
  ActiveVehicles())`. `ComputeMoveIntent`'s entire call tree (`LeaderFollowSpeedConstraint`,
  `StopLineConstraint`, `RedLightConstraint`, `JunctionYieldConstraint`/
  `AdaptToJunctionLeader`/`FindFoeVehicle`, `ObstacleConstraint`, `ProcessNextStop`) was verified
  to read ONLY start-of-step state (this vehicle's own `Kinematics`/lane/vType/stop-queue-front,
  the frozen pre-move `LaneNeighborQuery` snapshot Refilled once before `PlanMovements` runs, and
  the immutable network/config/obstacle/lane-sequence-pool/stop/avoided-edge side storage) and
  write ONLY `v.Intent` — no shared mutable accumulator, no lock, no cross-entity write anywhere
  in that call tree — so concurrent per-vehicle iteration is race-free by construction (see
  `UseParallelPlan`'s own header comment in `Engine.cs` for the full argument). `ExecuteMoves` and
  the post-move LC phase (`DecideSpeedGainChanges`, which has a genuine intra-phase
  read-after-write via the inline keep-right swap) are deliberately left sequential, per the
  briefing. New test `RungD8ParallelDeterminismTests` runs `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense` for
  120 steps with `UseParallelPlan=false` and again with `UseParallelPlan=true` and asserts the
  trajectory hashes are IDENTICAL and peak concurrent >= 50. `Sim.Bench` now runs both modes and
  reports each — the 500-step hash is `909605E965BFFE59` in BOTH modes, every run captured;
  measured speedup was small and noisy (1.01x–1.06x) on this shared 4-core VM (`PlanMovements` is
  only one of five per-step phases, and the workload is cheap enough post-D4 that `Parallel.For`'s
  own scheduling overhead competes with the parallelism dividend) — the byte-identical hash, not
  the speedup, is this rung's point. `dotnet test` = 63 green (62 + this rung's new test).
  Benchmark row appended to `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense/BASELINE.md`.
- **D9. Info/replication export SEAM (READINESS — NO FDP network wiring). DONE.**
  `VehicleExportSnapshot` (`src/Sim.Core/VehicleExportSnapshot.cs`, a `readonly struct`) — the
  "ECS component → external descriptor" SOURCE shape FDP's `IDescriptorTranslator` consumes:
  D5's `Entity` handle (the id a translator would key its external descriptor off) +
  `EntityIndex` (the plain side-table key) + the same `VehicleId`/`Time`/`Lane`/`Pos`/`Speed`/
  `X`/`Y`/`Angle` fields `TrajectoryPoint` already carries. `ISimExportObserver`
  (`src/Sim.Core/ISimExportObserver.cs`) — the observer seam a later `IDescriptorTranslator`-
  style consumer would implement: `OnVehicleExported(in VehicleExportSnapshot snapshot)` (passed
  `in`, never by value/boxed) plus optional no-op-by-default `OnFrameBegin(double time)`/
  `OnFrameEnd(double time)` bracket hooks. `Engine.AddExportObserver(ISimExportObserver)`
  registers into a new `_exportObservers` list, empty by default. `EmitTrajectory` (the
  `[SystemPhase.Export]` system) now builds ONE `VehicleExportSnapshot` per active vehicle per
  frame and (a) produces the exact same `TrajectoryPoint`/`trajectory.Add(...)` from it — same
  one `LaneGeometry.PositionAtOffset` call, same fields, same order, same null `Acceleration` —
  and (b) notifies every registered observer with that same snapshot (`in snapshot`); the
  `TrajectorySet` is the engine's own default, always-present consumer of the snapshot. With
  ZERO observers registered (the default — no existing scenario/test/benchmark calls
  `AddExportObserver`), the notify loop and the frame-bracket loops are empty `foreach`es over
  an empty list: no virtual call, no allocation, byte-identical to the pre-D9 `EmitTrajectory`
  body. New test `RungD9ExportObserverTests` registers an in-house recording
  `ISimExportObserver` on `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense` (120 steps, peak concurrent ≥ 50) and
  asserts the observer's (VehicleId, Time) set EQUALS the returned `TrajectorySet`'s (no
  vehicle/frame missing or extra) and every observed Lane/Pos/Speed/X/Y/Angle matches exactly —
  the "faithful mirror" property test the briefing asks for. No `FastDataPlane`/`Fdp.Core`
  reference, no `NetworkEntityMap`/`INetworkIdAllocator`, no network transport added anywhere —
  READINESS ONLY. `dotnet test` = 64 green (63 + this rung's new test). Trajectory hash
  UNCHANGED (`909605E965BFFE59` in both `hashA`/`hashPar`), alloc/veh-step unchanged (206.1 B
  single / 214.3–214.4 B parallel, matching D7's own 206.1 B/214.4 B exactly). Benchmark row
  appended to `scenarios/_bench/highway-dense/BASELINE.md`. Depends on D3/D7.

**Suggested Group-D order:** **D1** ✅ (measure) → **D2** ✅ (int handles) → **D3** (component structs +
move managed state out) → **D4** (zero-alloc hot path) → **D5** (entity lifecycle via command buffer)
→ **D6** (phased systems over queries) → **D7** (in-house FDP-shaped adapter seam) → **D8**
(parallelize) → **D9** (export seam). All in-house — READINESS, not integration: no `FastDataPlane`
dependency is added (D7/D9 are the drop-in seams the owner wires to `Fdp.Core` later). D2/D3 are the
load-bearing enablers; D4 is the biggest measurable alloc win; D8 proves the parallel payoff. Every
rung keeps the tests byte-identical — the refactor changes representation and speed, never behavior.
